<p>Most of this I should know, being a computer science teacher. However, outlining this should make teaching this rather boring portion easier. I want to try implementing more diagrams while I teach; I&rsquo;ll be looking forward to stealing their ideas.</p>
<h2 id="bits-and-bytes">Bits and bytes</h2>
<h3 id="how-do-computers-represent-data">How do computers represent data?</h3>
<p>All computers understand is <strong>Binary</strong>, 0&rsquo;s and 1&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>The video explains the example of using one single wire to transfer electricity through it; on or off. This is the most fundamental understanding of how our computers function. This is just one single bit. Common machines use hundreds of thousands of bits to achieve their objective.</p>
<p>With text, it&rsquo;s easier to visualize. Every character has a value related to some makeup of a 0 and a 1. Images are harder, since they&rsquo;re made up of tiny pixels. Each pixel holds a color. Each color can thankfully be represented by a number. Think about videos, that are rendering 30 to 60 images per second.</p>
<p>Audio can also be broken down into numbers, usually by vibrations as a waveform, and that waveform as a number.</p>
<p>Bits hold only a single value, on or off. Generally only binary decisions are used by single bits.</p>
<p>Computers will use multiple bits to represent more complex data. The more bits, the more information deliverable.</p>
<p>We can see that a sequence of two bits can represent four (<code>2^2</code>) distinct values:</p>
<p><code>00, 01, 10, 11</code></p>
<p>While a sequence of three bits can represent eight (<code>2^3</code>) distinct values:</p>
<p><code>000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111</code></p>
<p>While a bit is a single piece of information, a byte is a unit that consists of 8 bits.</p>
<p>The conversion is pretty simple: multiple by 8 to go from bits to bytes, and divide by 8 to go from bytes to bits.</p>
<h2 id="binary-numbers">Binary Numbers</h2>
<p>The binary number system works very similarly to how decimal numbers work.</p>
<p>In decimal numbers, you multiply each number by a different power of 10. You start in the ones&rsquo; place, the tens&rsquo; place, and the hundreds&rsquo; place. 234 is equal to <code>(2 * 100) + (3 * 10) + (4 * 1)</code>. Ones&rsquo; place is <code>10^0</code>, tens&rsquo; place is <code>10^1</code>, and hundreds&rsquo; place is <code>10^2</code>.</p>
<p>The binary number system multiplies to the power of 2 instead of 10.</p>
<p>The decimal number 1, can be represented in binary as 0001. That&rsquo;s the same as <code>(0 * 8) + (0 * 4) + (0 * 2) + (1 * 1)</code>, or <code>0 + 0 + 0 + 1</code>, which gives you 1.</p>
<p>The decimal number 10, in binary is 1010. We know this because of <code>(1 * 8) + (0 * 4) + (1 * 2) + (0 * 1)</code>, which is <code>8 + 0 + 2 + 0</code>, which equals 10.</p>

<h2 id="limitations-of-storing-numbers">Limitations of Storing Numbers</h2>
<h3 id="number-limits-overflow-and-roundoff">Number limits, overflow, and roundoff</h3>
<p>Storing numbers requires some work for binary representation. We run into issues with problems like <em>roundoff</em>, <em>overflow</em>, and <em>precision</em>. These issues are usually centered around memory issues.</p>
<h3 id="integer-representation">Integer representation</h3>
<p>An integer is any whole number: <code>1, 10, 230, -400</code> are all integers. In order to store integers, for however many bits the number is stored in, the first indicates the sign, and the others contain the absolute value.</p>

<h3 id="overflow">Overflow</h3>
<p>Let&rsquo;s suggest we only have 4-bits of memory to store our integers on a computer. That means we could only store up to the number 7. If we were to then try to go beyond it, like say with the following code:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>x <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">7</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>y <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> x <span style="color:#f92672">+</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p><code>x</code> is easily able to be stored, but <code>y</code> would give us a problem since it goes beyond the capabilities of our systems memory. This type of error is called an <em>Overflow Error</em>. Some systems might throw this error, truncate it to 7, or wrap back to 1.</p>
<p>Thankfully, 64-bit is the common standard.</p>
<h3 id="floating-point-representation">Floating-point representation</h3>
<p>Floating-point numbers represent every number that isn&rsquo;t an integer-irrational, fractional, etc.</p>
<p>In floating-point representation, a number is multiplied by a base that&rsquo;s raised to some exponent.</p>
<p>In mathematics it often looks like this: <code>300=3*10^2</code></p>
<p>Since computers use the binary system instead of the decimal system, it looks like this: <code>128=1*2^7</code>.</p>
<p>Numbers between the powers of 2 end up looking more so like this: <code>160=1.25*2^7</code>, or <code>0.25=1*2^-2</code>.</p>
<p>Modern 64 bit systems use 1 bit for the sign, 11 bits for the exponent, and 52 bits for the number in the front.</p>
<h3 id="roundoff-errors">Roundoff errors</h3>
<p>There are still some issues since there are some numbers that can&rsquo;t be easily represented. <code>.3^-</code> (repeating) is an infinitely repeating sequence that can&rsquo;t be stored in any device. The computer will eventually have to round at some point. A <em>roundoff error</em> is when we get an unexpected error due to the computers rounding of a complicated-to-represent number.</p>

<h2 id="storing-text-in-binary">Storing Text in Binary</h2>
<p>Obviously, computers can do more than just store numbers. For example, we often use emojis. These icons, or symbols, are agreed upon and referenced under an <em>encoding</em> system.</p>
<p>Encoding systems all have names to make it easier to discern what they&rsquo;re used for. If we assign a peace sign to the value 10, and and heart to the value 01, we could say 0110 would be a heart then a peace sign. But, the computer just has to store the values, instead of having to find a way to store those icons in binary.</p>
<p><strong>ASCII Encoding</strong> is a common encoding standard that is still used today. It&rsquo;s encoded using 7-bit binary, meaning it can only have 128 permutations. Many of the codes are for actions, like line return or space. While the letters have both upper and lowercase variations, as well as numbers.</p>
<p>ASCII&rsquo;s problems stem from it&rsquo;s lack of scalability. ASCII can only account for words written in plain English: any accent marks or foreign letters won&rsquo;t work. Same goes for any Chinese or Japanese kanji.</p>
<p>Since ASCII is also 7-bit, and Computers store things in parts of 8-bits, there&rsquo;s a small waste of memory.</p>
<p>To solve these problems and make computers more accessible, programmers started with <strong>Unicode</strong>. Unicode is a character set that has a code point (stored in hexadecimal) for each of the world&rsquo;s language-characters. Currently, Unicode has over 130,000 characters represented.</p>
<p>The encoding system used alongside Unicode is <strong>UTF-8</strong>, that works with both ASCII and Unicode. UTF-8 has the ability to represent any Unicode character using ASCII code, while only using 1 to 4 bytes.</p>
<p>UTF-8 works pretty interestingly to define how many bytes are used with it&rsquo;s binary representation: if there are no <code>1</code>&rsquo;s in the prefix, that means the character a single byte and can be represented using ASCII. If there are two <code>1</code>&rsquo;s, there are two bytes, 3 <code>1</code>&rsquo;s means three bytes, and so on to four.</p>
<h2 id="converting-analog-data-to-binary">Converting Analog Data to Binary</h2>
<p>The real doesn&rsquo;t work in binary; it moves too fast and constant. This data is called <strong>Analog</strong> data.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s far too complicated to just take in and display, but we can do a few steps in order to get there. Let&rsquo;s start with a basic analog signal.</p>

    <img src="/images/analog_signal.png"  alt="Analog Signal"  class="center"  style="border-radius: 8px;"  />


<p>We could grab a random point on the green line and define the analog information in terms of seconds long or volts used.</p>
<p><strong>Sampling</strong> is the process of selecting points after a desired interval (every 1 second, every 30 milliseconds, etc.). If we were to grab a point from the above graph every 30 milliseconds:</p>

    <img src="/images/analog_signal_2.png"  alt="Analog Signal"  class="center"  style="border-radius: 8px;"  />


<p>Each orange point would become a (x, y) coordinate. It could play these 9 orange points, and depending on the complexity of the sound, it could either be or not be enough to accurately display it.</p>
<p>We call the <em>sampling rate</em> the number of samples taken in some unit of time. Given the above example, with a sampling interval of 30 milliseconds, it would take 33.33 samples per second.</p>
<p>We can quantify a sufficient sampling rate by saying that the rate should be larger or equal to twice the highest frequency in said signal. This is where we get hertz from; frequency can be defined as the number of cycles per second, which get measured in Hz.</p>
<p>If we say, have a signal with a max of 250 Hz, we should use a sampling rate of at least 500 Hz. The sampling rate for music is commonly 48 kHz.</p>
<p>Since noise is constant and difficult to quantify still, we need to incorporate <strong>Quantization</strong>. Using our example from above, we can break it down to say that our signal has a range of about -100 to 100 volts. To make things simple, we can easily use intervals of 25 volts to take in data more uniformly:</p>

    <img src="/images/analog_signal_3.png"  alt="Analog Signal"  class="center"  style="border-radius: 8px;"  />


<p>The blue points are our nicely formatted coordinates; they may not be exact, but they&rsquo;ll approximate.</p>
<p>The last part of our encoding process is <em>binary encoding</em>. In situations where there aren&rsquo;t many quantized y-values, the computer does not need to store the actual value. These values get stored as a binary sequence.</p>
<p>For a computer to understand that binary sequence, it also needs to have information on how it was sampled and encoded. We can use <em>bit depth</em> to represent bits per sample.</p>
<p>Telephone calls have a bit depth of 8 bits (256 values) while YouTube music videos is 24 bits (over 16 million values).</p>
<p>After all of these steps, we put them back together in a process called <em>Reconstruction</em>. The reconstruction will look very close to the original, but will mess some specific things up.</p>
