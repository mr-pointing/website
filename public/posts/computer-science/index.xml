<p>A <em>cookie</em> is a piece of data sent from a web server to a web browser filled with information about the client and session, created when the request was sent from the client to the server.</p>
<p>The three main reasons why you&rsquo;d want to use cookies would be:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Session Info:</strong> Storing the session info in the cookie allows you to do things like refresh the page or link to another page without having to retype in your user information.</li>
<li><strong>Personalization:</strong> Cookies will actually track the things you do on websites that are custom or personal to you, and even remember the interaction so it will prompt your information to log-in again, instead of another user.</li>
<li><strong>Tracking:</strong> The first two sort of count as tracking, but in a more literal sense. Take for example; how do adds on other websites know you&rsquo;ve been shopping for a certain product on Amazon? Third-party tracking cookies.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are also different types of cookies:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Session:</strong> Meant to track the user&rsquo;s session. They have no expiration date, which lets the browser know they should be deleted once the session is determined to be over (usually through a log-out method, or a page close).</li>
<li><strong>Persistent:</strong> Cookies that stay in the browser for some fixed length of time. They must have some expiration date however, so they&rsquo;re certainly not infinite.</li>
<li><strong>Authentication:</strong> Meant to maintain sensitive user info, usually log-in information.</li>
<li><strong>Tracking:</strong> Meant to record user activity.</li>
<li><strong>Zombie:</strong> Exactly what it sounds like, cookies that come back from the dead. Cookies make backups of themselves, so even after deleted more are made. Usually made or sent by ads or hackers.</li>
</ul>

Fourth Edition Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, Clifford Stein Preface Algorithms are everywhere, apart of almost everything we do, and every decision we make. They are part of most if not all tech stacks used today.
Each chapter in this book will present an algorithm, an application area for some algorithm, or some other related topic.
For teaching purposes The less complex the audience, the less complex chapters you need.</description>

<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>
<p>Algorithms are everywhere, apart of almost everything we do, and every decision we make. They are part of most if not all tech stacks used today.</p>
<p>Each chapter in this book will present an algorithm, an application area for some algorithm, or some other related topic.</p>
<h3 id="for-teaching-purposes">For teaching purposes</h3>
<p>The less complex the audience, the less complex chapters you need. You can pick and choose what you want to take from this, being so comprehensive of a text. Even a section instead of a whole chapter is completely viable.</p>
<p>There are 931 exercises and 162 problems (I&rsquo;ll attempt all of them).</p>
<p>Solutions are <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/algorithms/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Starred chapters are meant for for graduate students, rather than undergrad. They aren&rsquo;t necessarily harder, but might feature harder math, more complex concepts, etc.</p>
<h3 id="for-students">For students</h3>
<p>A question: what are some of the pre-requisites for this book?</p>
<ul>
<li>Some programming experience, specifically with:
<ul>
<li>Recursive procedures</li>
<li>Simple data structures (arrays, linked lists)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mathematical Proofs
<ul>
<li>Proofs by mathematical induction</li>
<li>Elementary calculus</li>
<li>Part 1 &amp; Appendices A - D explain all math needed</li>
</ul>

Get Acquainted with PyCharm The project view is one of the main tool windows, containing the project directory, external libraries, and scratch files. You can also open it with Alt 1. The Python interpreter is easily viewable in the status bar in the bottom right. You can run, debug, or other option on the top right of the window. You can also press Shift F10. We got an unexpected error in our code, featured below.</description>

Taken from this article.
Often in projects, we want to format our large float types as smaller percentages.
There are three main ways to do this:
Rounding and Float/String Types: round() takes two parameters: a value and a number to round too. Then, we can use a little complicated string statement.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; number = 0.8839133112 &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; n2 = round(number, 4) &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print(n2) 0.886 &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print(str(n2 * 100) + &amp;#39;%&amp;#39;) Format() Alternatively, if that seems a bit complicated, we can just format() instead.</description>

A resource by Code Basics
We&amp;rsquo;ll see how this works. Starting in June of 2024, I plan to get myself prepared for a new career after another year of teaching. Pretty much; I want to find a job ideally that starts in the late summer of next year.
Week 0 is stupid lol.
Week 1 and 2 (6/2 - 6/17) I have a masters degree in this subject.</description>

<p>We&rsquo;ll see how this works. Starting in June of 2024, I plan to get myself prepared for a new career after another year of teaching. Pretty much; I want to find a job ideally that starts in the late summer of next year.</p>
<p>Week 0 is stupid lol.</p>
<h2 id="week-1-and-2-62---617"><strong>Week 1 and 2 (6/2 - 6/17)</strong></h2>
<p>I have a masters degree in this subject. I think I can handle a khan academy course and going through the entire Python documentation in two weeks. Or at least I hope I can.</p>
<p>6/18/2024
So, after two weeks, I was able to go through a decent chunk of the Python documentation. It was hubris that thought I could complete something as dense as the Python docs in two weeks.</p>
<p>I was also able to accomplish a few Leet Code questions, as well as explore a few potential projects for the next coming weeks.</p>
<h2 id="week-3-and-4-618---72"><strong>Week 3 and 4 (6/18 - 7/2)</strong></h2>
<p>The next two weeks what I&rsquo;d like to accomplish:</p>
<ul>
<li><input checked="" disabled="" type="checkbox"> Finish The Python Tutorial</li>
<li><input checked="" disabled="" type="checkbox"> Start the Library Reference</li>
<li><input checked="" disabled="" type="checkbox"> Finish 4 Leet Code Problems</li>
<li><input checked="" disabled="" type="checkbox"> Start a project from <a href="https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x?tab=readme-ov-file#build-your-own-git">this</a> GitHub</li>
</ul>
<p>7/3/2024
Another two weeks in. I definitely overshot myself, which isn&rsquo;t a bad thing. I think 4 goals isn&rsquo;t terrible: I can break it down into two tasks a week. I&rsquo;ll have a little bit better expectation going forward.</p>
<p>Here are some tech videos I watched in the last two weeks:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdnxjYj1pS0">Compilers, How They Work, And Writing Them From Scratch</a></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember why but I saw this and thought it was super interesting.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mN3VyJuCjM&t=4s">What Is REST API? Examples And How To Use It: Crash Course System Design #3</a></p>
<p>This really helped my understanding of REST and helped me understand that concepts I used in my <a href="http://localhost:1313/projects/designing-a-restful-api/">Designing a RESTful API</a> note. The notes on the REST there.</p>
<p>On that note, I think a project a week is worth it.</p>
<p>As far as the PDF goes, I&rsquo;m pretty much at where they expect.</p>
<h2 id="week-5-and-6-73---717"><strong>Week 5 and 6 (7/3 - 7/17)</strong></h2>
<p>The next accomplishments I want to make over the next two weeks:</p>
<ul>
<li><input checked="" disabled="" type="checkbox"> Start &amp; Complete a <a href="https://wyag.thb.lt/">Git project</a></li>
<li><input checked="" disabled="" type="checkbox"> Finish The Python Tutorial</li>
<li><input checked="" disabled="" type="checkbox"> Start the Flask Documentation</li>
<li><input checked="" disabled="" type="checkbox"> Watch 3 videos from my YouTube watchlist</li>
</ul>
<p>7/17/2024</p>
<p>I was able to accomplish a lot more this week than last; or at least collect a lot more information I want to learn about.</p>
<p>I finished the Python documentation, but want more info on how to use Python as an object oriented language. I played around with a few examples but I’d like a structured walk through to turn into a lesson for my upperclassmen.</p>
<p>I technically did finish 3 YouTube videos, but since I only did a write up on two of them, I’ll say it wasn’t accomplished.</p>
<p>I’m going to keep up 4 objectives; I might reuse one or two.</p>
<p><a href="http://localhost:1313/posts/computer-science/videos/become-a-shell-wizard-in-~12-minutes/">Become a Shell Wizard in ~12 Minutes</a> was the first video which got me way more excited to learn DevOps stuff.</p>
<p><a href="http://localhost:1313/posts/computer-science/videos/you-can-do-really-cool-things-with-functions-in-python/">You Can Do Really Cool Things With Functions in Python</a> also got me excited, and really pushed me to want to understand more complex Python. Again, more Object Oriented Concepts, mixed with Data classes.</p>
<p>Starting the <a href="http://localhost:1313/posts/computer-science/flask-notes/flask/">Flask</a> documentation also got me working on my capstone project again. I will have to make a note here to track all of that progress.</p>
<p>I’m also starting something new these next two weeks. The objective for the next week is to study algorithms; something I’m particularly bad at. In order to study harder, and hopefully retain more info, I’m going to take notes by hand, then transfer them to Obsidian. We’ll see how that works</p>
<h2 id="week-7-and-8-718---81"><strong>Week 7 and 8 (7/18 - 8/1)</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><input checked="" disabled="" type="checkbox"> Watch 3 YouTube videos from CompSci</li>
</ul>
<p>8/2/2024</p>
<p>I got a lot done, more so than I thought I was going to. Not only that, I&rsquo;ve really cleared out my projects list for the next few months. I want to prioritize my time to get my website up, so I can start some online presence. I definitely didn&rsquo;t get anywhere near close to finished with Chapters 1-9, but it&rsquo;s very dense text.</p>
<p><a href="http://localhost:1313/posts/computer-science/videos/browsers-http-and-you/">Browsers HTTP and You!</a> was pretty bunk, the video wasn&rsquo;t very popular and it seemed like it was one of his first videos because he didn&rsquo;t talk very confidently. I stopped after 5 minutes.</p>
<p><a href="http://localhost:1313/posts/computer-science/videos/how-to-start-a-homelab-for-0/">How to Start a Homelab for $0</a> is more of the same from this YouTuber. I&rsquo;ve been watching his videos following his influence on wanting to use Hugo to host my website. Homelab seems cool, but it&rsquo;s definitely lower on my list considering what else I&rsquo;d like to do right now.</p>
<p><a href="http://localhost:1313/posts/computer-science/videos/how-to-use-@dataclass-in-python/">How To Use @dataclass in Python</a> was really interesting, I want to start working on some projects and try to find ways to use data classes instead of regular classes.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;d like to keep the same objectives for the next two weeks.</p>
