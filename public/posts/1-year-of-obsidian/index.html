<p>It has been a wild year. It&rsquo;s hard to even think of a time where I didn&rsquo;t have my online notebook as a backup for all of the important information I need on a daily basis. It&rsquo;s moved and changed slightly here and there, but at the end of the day it&rsquo;s consistently been-what I think is the most important part-useful.</p>
<p>Some topics have come and gone. After trying out diary entries I realized I don&rsquo;t get the same sense of satisfaction from it as I do when I write in my physical journal, so that came and went. I only lightly use the dictionary portion of my vault that I don&rsquo;t make public. It&rsquo;s mostly words I come across in books that I have to look up and write down to try and not forget it.</p>
<p>Computer Science as a topic is through and through mostly what I write about since this platform was originally a place to put my notes for my students. That plan hasn&rsquo;t changed, but I&rsquo;d like to expand eventually.</p>
<p>Of all the projects I took on, the one&rsquo;s I&rsquo;ll continue with most are the textbook breakdowns and project trackers. My notes on getting <a href="https://www.capricornpokes.com">Capricornpokes</a> finished helped keep track of everything without getting too cluttered or confusing, so that&rsquo;s for sure going to be a part of all my future projects as of right now.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t finish books fast enough for that to actually make a dent in the makeup of my vault, but I hope in a few years time to have more posts under the entertainment tab. Honestly the more I write that I want to change the name to something else but that is a year 2 problem. Here are some fun stats as of <strong><em>June 19th, 2025</em></strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>385 Notes</li>
<li>407 Files</li>
<li>21 Attachments</li>
<li>306 Links</li>
<li>136,433 words</li>
<li>13.71 MB</li>
<li>116 Excalidraw Drawings</li>
</ul>
<p>Now the only number I don&rsquo;t really trust there is the word count, due to Excalidraw files skewing that a bit (without them I had 129,650!), but still, not too bad for a first year. Here&rsquo;s a look at my graph view;</p>

    <img src="/images/screenshot_19062025_105026.jpg"  alt="Obsidian screenshot"  class="center"  style="border-radius: 8px;"  />


<p>I use the Shiba Inu theme with minor tweaks in the settings to add some color pop on the file explorer and background image. I don&rsquo;t use too many community plugins;</p>
<ul>
<li>Templater</li>
<li>Excalidraw</li>
<li>Omnisearch</li>
<li>Style Settings</li>
<li>Update Time on Edit</li>
<li>Chesser</li>
</ul>
<p>And lastly, of course, I host all my notes using Hugo :)</p>
