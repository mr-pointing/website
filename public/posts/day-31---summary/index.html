<p>I can&rsquo;t believe I worked on this project for 30 days. The growth has been fantastic, and I should be proud of all that I was able to accomplish. If this is true, why do I feel a pit in my stomach when I think about this project? If I did such a good job, why do I feel like such crap?</p>
<p>To be honest, the more I worked on this the more I understood why it takes teams of people to produce applications. I know there are gurus out there who can solo develop their ideas, but wow I never realized how <em>not</em> like that I am. I enjoyed every part of the development process, yet the more I saw of the road ahead of me to actually make this usable? That is what really scared me.</p>
<p>When I look at my work, it&rsquo;s difficult to not see all the faults. CSS is not my strong suit, and I know I cut corners in some areas (please don&rsquo;t resize my windows ಥ_ಥ). I made separate pages for things that could have easily been one page. I ended up ditching an entire process and offloaded in onto Calendly, which takes away from the entire point of the project if you think about it too much. The more I produced, the more inadequate I felt. I felt like there was more I should have done, more time I should have spent learning x or practicing y.</p>
<p>This is the wrong way of thinking about it. I have a lot to be thankful for, and I&rsquo;m happy I was able to say I worked on something I&rsquo;m passionate about. I&rsquo;m walking away from this project with a better understanding of API&rsquo;s, writing and handling requests, storing images via SQLite, sending emails with Yagmail, actually using JavaScript for the first time, and much more.</p>
<p>If anything, seeing how much I didn&rsquo;t know motivated me to just learn <strong>more</strong>. I started going through the <a href="https://mrpointing.com/notes/computer-science/front-end/the-odin-project/fundamental-css-properties/">Odin Project</a>, finally admitting to myself that yeah, I should probably learn JavaScript. I started looking into responsive design and best practices of working on the front-end of applications. The structure of working on my project alone has changed my perspective on my daily structure; I&rsquo;ve started journaling to hold myself more accountable and have an outlet for my emotions and frantic thoughts.</p>
<p>I do feel sad that I&rsquo;m walking away from these 30 days, and I&rsquo;m no where near a master level engineer, and I don&rsquo;t have a fully functional project. Was that the reason I started though? Not really.</p>
<p>I started these 30 days because I wanted to see if I could do it. No, the days weren&rsquo;t consecutive, but why does it have to be? I don&rsquo;t have to place arbitrary rules on things I design for myself. Had I been so serious about it, I likely would have never made it to day 30.</p>
<p>I started these 30 days because I wanted to be a good influence on my students, and show them that they should be proud to work on something, and make progress on their own creations.</p>
<p>I started these 30 days because I love my wife, and what better way to show that love than make something she can use in her professional life.</p>
<p>The reasons outweigh the reflective feelings. The longer you stare into the abyss, the more the abyss looks back (or something like that). I&rsquo;m never going to be done learning, and that&rsquo;s okay. To think there is some summit to reach where you&rsquo;ll find all the masters sitting and waiting for you is a false flag. You&rsquo;re never going to get there, but neither will the masters. The journey of learning is an ongoing process, and as long as you love the process, you&rsquo;ll never stop learning.</p>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t already checked it out, please give my project a look at! <a href="https://mrpointing.com/projects/30-day-coding-challenge/week-1/day-1/">Day 1</a></p>
