I finished The Road a few days ago and I&amp;rsquo;ve reflected fondly on the experience. Slow burn isn&amp;rsquo;t the word I&amp;rsquo;d use; perhaps a slow agonizing death. Because by the end, I was emotionally exhausted. It asks a lot of you. Sit through the gray, dim world that the story takes place in. Hope to some God the end is worth it. In my opinion, I think it was.</description><content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Modified: July 14 2024</p>

<p>I finished The Road a few days ago and I&rsquo;ve reflected fondly on the experience. Slow burn isn&rsquo;t the word I&rsquo;d use; perhaps a slow agonizing death. Because by the end, I was emotionally exhausted. It asks a lot of you. Sit through the gray, dim world that the story takes place in. Hope to some God the end is worth it. In my opinion, I think it was.</p>
<p>Part of what drove me to wanting to finish it despite the opening and middle of this book almost being too boring to comply with, was the background lore between the father and son. Neither being given a name, keeping you far and as unattached as you can; you still develop feelings and connections to their struggle. You feel for the child as his innocence dies and fades. You feel for the father as he physically is dying, until his actual untimely death.</p>
<p>The moment of his loss, where they said goodbye, drove me to tears. Even though I wasn&rsquo;t able to fully immerse myself in the world, even though I wasn&rsquo;t fully head over heels in love with the pacing, I was emotionally invested enough to feel something. Solid 4 out of 5.</p>

I finished Words of Radiance two days ago, and it initially got a 4 out of 5. I loved the book. I really did, and was invested from start to finish.
It took me about 3 weeks (3 weeks and 3 days says Goodreads) and it really flew by. I enjoyed tackling such a huge tome of a novel.
The characters were awesome, even if I felt like the interlude characters could have been longer to make them a bit more memorable.</description><content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Modified: July 02 2024</p>

<p>I finished Words of Radiance two days ago, and it initially got a 4 out of 5. I loved the book. I really did, and was invested from start to finish.</p>
<p>It took me about 3 weeks (3 weeks and 3 days says Goodreads) and it really flew by. I enjoyed tackling such a huge tome of a novel.</p>
<p>The characters were awesome, even if I felt like the interlude characters could have been longer to make them a bit more memorable. I only remember maybe one of them, and it was Lift cause they had a really cool attitude and wanted to just eat some good food.</p>
<p>I cheered on a few occasions, especially during the duels. I cried on two occasions; when Syl returns and when Kaladin saves the day and takes Szeth on. I loved Kaladin as a character and really hope the next book does him the justice he deserves. I also want to see more of Adolin, now that everyone around him is special excluding himself. Even Renarin is a Radiant, while Adolin is just a dueler.</p>
<p>One of the main themes I enjoyed that took place throughout the entire book is facing the truth of your reality, and the lies we tell ourself to ignore that truth. Pretty much every character had a lie to either each other or themselves, and more often both. It&rsquo;s incredibly relatable, and often found myself reflecting on what was going on in my own life.</p>
<p>I changed the rating to a 5 out of 5 after some deliberation and thought. I think it deserves it for keeping my attention for just under 1100 pages. The next book, Oathkeeper I think, is up soon. I bought it a while ago at Strand with Sarah, so let&rsquo;s hope it&rsquo;s just as if not better.</p>

I finished Naruto today. I really enjoyed reading it; I nearly flew through it in just over or under 3 months. I had a blast-Kishimoto&amp;rsquo;s art was really fun and emotive and kept me wanting to see just how each page would grow in more detail and impact. I think it delivered in that respect. The last 100 chapters had many great panels-none screenshot worthy in my opinion like the beginning/middle of the series but regardless a lot of fun.</description><content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Modified: August 02 2024</p>

<p>The story couldn&rsquo;t have ended in any other way that would have felt satisfying. Sasuke is through and through a dick. I think him getting with Sakura is cope and is for the fans. From the jump this guy has straight up not given her the time of day. I read the whole series and I now can say with my chest there&rsquo;s no fucking way Sasuke/Sakura makes sense.</p>
<p>Women overall are poorly written as a critique makes a lot of sense given his female characters all care about men in some regard a little too much. Tsunade pretty much just cared about Konoha like a boss (Dan but he died). Maybe Kuranai might stand out as the only one who had a goal non-adjacent to another guy but then Asuna dies and she has his child so. Not sure how to feel about that.</p>
<p>Once I link my phone I&rsquo;ll upload some of my favorite screenshots. I think that might be a good way to remember the series.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad to do this. Since my brain is fried, I forget critical moments like whole series if I don&rsquo;t take some substantial time for reflection. Even if I do, I can just look back and this and remember.</p>

26 short essays on the pieces/lines of code that shaped the modern understanding of computer science.
6/3/24
Halfway through, I think some of the stories are interesting. Some of the articles don&amp;rsquo;t go as deep as I think they could/should; some bring up gender/race for seemingly no reason&amp;hellip;others actually delve deeper into the politics of it encouragingly.
