      <description>Bits and Bytes Not a dense chapter, but we should recognize that Lua handles binary data very similarly to text. Let&amp;rsquo;s dive right into it.&#xA;Bitwise Operators There are a few Lua operators that work only on integers and binary data; &amp;amp; or AND, | or OR, ~ or BITWISE OR, &amp;gt;&amp;gt; or SHIFT RIGHT, &amp;lt;&amp;lt; or SHIFT LEFT, and ~ which can also mean BITWISE NOT.&#xA;string.format(&amp;#34;%x&amp;#34;, 0xff &amp;amp; 0xabcd) --&amp;gt; cd string.</description>

      <description>Date and Time Not Lua&amp;rsquo;s strong-suit, but there are ways to retrieve and filter on date and time. Although, the system is quite weird.&#xA;Lua officially has two ways of representing date and time. First is a single number, known as the number of seconds from the epoch, or some fixed date. POSIX and Windows use the date January 1st, 1970, 0:00 UTC.&#xA;The second is through a table that&amp;rsquo;s a lot more human readable.</description>

      <description>Link to article&#xA;A simple built-in string method of Python, .join() allows you to combine strings passed through an iterable of strings, using a separator string as the delimiter.&#xA;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; facts = [&amp;#39;Giorno&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;is&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;the&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;strongest&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Jojo&amp;#39;] &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &amp;#34; &amp;#34;.join(facts) &amp;#34;Giorno is the strongest Jojo&amp;#34; # You could also set the delimiter into it&amp;#39;s own variable for more modularity &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; separator = &amp;#34; &amp;#34; &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; separator.join(facts) &amp;#34;Giorno is the strongest Jojo&amp;#34; You don&amp;rsquo;t have to use a whitespace either if you don&amp;rsquo;t want too.</description>

      <description>Pattern Matching Due to Lua&amp;rsquo;s goal of maintaining a lite and quick language, it relies on it&amp;rsquo;s own method of pattern matching rather than POSIX regex or even Perl regex.&#xA;Pattern Matching Functions There are four pattern matching functions within Lua&amp;rsquo;s standard string library. We&amp;rsquo;ve actually already seen two of them, find and gsub. We will cover those in slightly more detail, as well as the other two, match and gmatch.</description>

      <description>Question: You are given an integer n. Return all well-formed parentheses strings that you can generate with n pairs of parentheses.&#xA;Example 1:&#xA;Input: n = 1 Output: [&amp;#34;()&amp;#34;] Example 2:&#xA;Input: n = 3 Output: [&amp;#34;((()))&amp;#34;,&amp;#34;(()())&amp;#34;,&amp;#34;(())()&amp;#34;,&amp;#34;()(())&amp;#34;,&amp;#34;()()()&amp;#34;] How to Solve:&#xA;This one was rough. It was hard to imagine exactly how to get all of the different configurations of the parenthesis. I started out with a basic for loop to create the most basic version, or the first from the examples;</description>

      <description>After going through Programming in Lua, I started watching a video series on learning Neovim. It really got me wanting to try out Neovim, so I started with the tutor. I&amp;rsquo;ll probably just throw in a few of the most important things I learn in each chapter of the tutor.&#xA;Chapter 1 Moving can be done with the arrows or h, j, k, and l to move left, down, up, and right respectively You can open any file in Neovim with nvim FILENAME.</description>

      <description>Closures The first advanced topic, more of a clarification, let&amp;rsquo;s discuss the true nature of functions and how they&amp;rsquo;re treated in Lua.&#xA;Any function inside Lua is a first-class value, meaning they are treated with similar properties as strings and numbers. This implies that not only can we store functions inside of variables, but we can also pass functions as arguments.&#xA;Another concept that gives Lua additional flexibility is lexical scoping, meaning nested functions have automatic access to variables in their enclosing function.</description>

      <description>Filling in Some Gaps A quick send off chapter for the basics of Lua. Let&amp;rsquo;s review some key components that are necessary, but maybe doesn&amp;rsquo;t need an entire chapter.&#xA;Local Variables and Blocks Quite simply, Lua makes all variables global by default. To specify a local variable, you have to call it with local in front. Local variables only have a scope inside the block it was declared in.</description>

      <description>The External World Lua is not the language for powerful performance with the exterior world. Even the text admits that most use of Input and Output are done through the host application or external libraries. Lua can handle basic file manipulation, which we&amp;rsquo;ll review now.&#xA;The Simple I/O Model Lua assumes the use of two streams, the current input stream and the current output stream. Using C terminology, the current input is default stdin while output is stdout.</description>

      <description>After deep reflection, I still lack the ability to properly give my feedback while remaining professional. This was an incredibly difficult read. Not only was it incredibly lengthy and full of citations and footnotes, it was dense with historical information and new vocabulary. I found myself looking up definitions, synopsis&amp;rsquo; of political parties and events, and having to watch numerous supplemental material to actually follow along. Was this a good thing?</description>

      <description>Functions Functions in Lua are the main method of abstracting out commands. We&amp;rsquo;ve been using functions the entire time. Like most other languages, we can accomplish direct tasks or solve complicated problems with repeatable calls.&#xA;When calling functions, we use parenthesis, even when there are no parameters. The only time we can leave parenthesis out is when the argument is a literal string or a table constructor.&#xA;A fun addition of Lua is the colon operator, which supports method like calling;</description>

      <description>Tables Funnily enough, tables are the only data structure natively in Lua. Tables can be used to represent basic arrays, sets, records, and others. We&amp;rsquo;ll see some of these created this chapter.&#xA;By default, a table acts like a Python dictionary, or an associative array. They can contain any number or string value, except for nil. The tables themselves are considered objects. Programs only manipulate references to a table; Lua will never create a hidden copy of your table.</description>

      <description>Strings A string is basically a representation of some text. They can be tiny, or huge, depending on how you&amp;rsquo;d like. We consider strings as a sequence of bytes, which we can go into more detail on later. For now, just know we can store any binary data as a string, or even Unicode representation.&#xA;Any string we make in Lua is immutable, so we can&amp;rsquo;t alter it once it&amp;rsquo;s made.</description>

      <description>Controlling Layouts with Geometry Managers Tkinter has three geometry managers, or methods that define how the content of your app is structured. .pack() is just one of them; we also could use .place() or .grid(). You can only use one at a time, so let&amp;rsquo;s discover the instances in which we&amp;rsquo;d use them.&#xA;.pack() When using .pack(), you&amp;rsquo;re actually using a packing algorithm in order to place the widgets on screen.</description>

      <description>The above has taught you how to make things appear inside your window. This will only get you so far; the things in your window need to do things. Let&amp;rsquo;s learn about events.&#xA;Using Events and Event Handlers Going back to when we learned about the window.mainloop(), the loop this starts is known as the event loop. During this, the window will wait for some response. All we have to code is the events that we want to happen in response to these events, otherwise known as event handlers.</description>

      <description>Data Types What is a data type? Data types are a collection of data values and set of pre-defined operations on those values. One major benefit of data typing is error catching. Another is documentation; we can tell a lot about about a program based on it&amp;rsquo;s data types and types used.&#xA;The two most common structured (non-scalar) data types are arrays and records. Structured data types defined w/ type operators, or constructors (C uses brackets for arrays, asterisks for pointers).</description>

      <description>Numbers Up until recently, all numbers in Lua were floating point numbers. Now, Lua past version 5.3, has two representations for numbers; 64-bit integers and double-precision floating points, just floats.&#xA;The Lua interpreter will allow the input of numbers in whatever format you want, and return it that way (unless specified not too).&#xA;&amp;gt; 4 --&amp;gt; 4 &amp;gt; 0.4 --&amp;gt; 0.4 &amp;gt; 4.57e-3 --&amp;gt; 0.00457 &amp;gt; 0.3e12 --&amp;gt; 300000000000.0 &amp;gt; 5E+20 --&amp;gt; 5e+20 If you call type() on any number, it will always return as a number type.</description>

Please feel free to dive into each of these topics on your own, as each is large enough to devote an entire chapter to.&#xA;Linear Regression Given a data set of points, a line of best fit is generated to make predictions. This is one of the first topics covered when you begin learning about Machine Learning (due to how easy it is to set up), so you&amp;rsquo;re likely going to have first hand experience with this soon enough.</description>

      <description>Balanced Trees From on out, if an array or linked list isn&amp;rsquo;t enough, a tree should be our next structure to try. It&amp;rsquo;s a balancing act to choose between both, especially for run time. Binary Search Trees are great, especially for insertion.&#xA;Remember, arrays take longer to insert than linked lists, but provide faster sorts. Binary Search Trees optimize by providing a clear and easy to understand structure: a root node with values larger to their right, and smaller to the left.</description>

      <description>Dijkstra&amp;rsquo;s Algorithm Dijkstra&amp;rsquo;s Algorithm calculates the shortest path on a weighted graph. Unlike Breadth-first search, every step we take has some cost associated with it that we have to take into account. Just like last chapter, we can use graphs to help us get a better understanding:&#xA;From what we know of BFS, we can assume it would probably return &amp;ldquo;Start -&amp;gt; A -&amp;gt; Finish&amp;rdquo; as the shortest path. without weights, that makes perfect sense.</description>

      <description>Trees A subset of graphs, trees are similarly made with nodes and edges and come in multiple different varieties. The first tree we are going to look at is the rooted tree, which is quite easy to visualize.&#xA;Rooted trees must have one node that heads to all other nodes in the tree. Nodes have at most one parent, and the only node with no parent is known as the root node.</description>

      <description>Getting Started Just like any other language, standard output is a great first step. To do so on a windows machine, you have to download Lua much like you do Python, and run it via the command line. The fastest way I did this was through a command line installer scoop, and installed it with scoop install lua. Then just use lua to run your environment.&#xA;A simple print() will put anything on the screen:</description>

Hash functions are any function that does the mapping of a value to an input.&#xA;Two main rules when implementing hash tables:&#xA;Pairings should be consistent Key&amp;rsquo;s should be unique The way these mappings work are complex, but essentially, when using Python, grabbing values from a dictionary is pretty fast and grants instant access.</description>

      <description>Quicksort Divide and Conquer To introduce another tool into our algorithm toolbox, we can introduce Divide &amp;amp; Conquer, a useful method to recursively solve problems. Just like we learned in recursion, we need to identify our base case. Then we divide our problem into smaller problems, until we eventually reach our base case.&#xA;We can use the example of a plot of land:&#xA;If we wanted to divide our land into perfectly even square boxes, making sure to use all available land with no land left out.</description>

When you want to store a value, in a variable, that variable name is given an address, and whatever value is stored inside of it. Incredibly simple for single value variables- but what about multiple items? This is where picking an array or a linked list comes in.</description>

      <description>Probability and Information Theory When we encounter situations where the output is unknown, probability theory gives us a mathematical framework to deal with these statements. They use the term &amp;ldquo;quantifying uncertainty&amp;rdquo; which I like a lot. The connection between AI applications and probability come from two places; algorithms often use probability theory to give AI it&amp;rsquo;s reasoning abilities, and probability with statistics are used to grade and categorize the behavior of the AI models/agents.</description>

      <description>Goal Get current bookings page working Look into filtering requests/bookings Don&amp;rsquo;t want to have to refresh the page, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to constantly update as the user is typing. Results should only appear upon hitting enter. Accomplishments Current bookings was a lot easier now that I&amp;rsquo;m using a template for all my pages, and it was a breeze to create a new blueprint for the page since it&amp;rsquo;s even less code than the requests page, due to their not needing to handle any post requests.</description>

      <description>Goal Coming back from a few days to think about a game plan for the finish line, I think I can get something out and working by the end of these 30 days. Maybe.&#xA;Finish applying base.html to all pages Make the admin index page for current requests page for current bookings page for manual application form Finish CSS for pages Accomplishments Got a ton done today, and worked for probably over 2 hours.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re on our final chapter, and almost through with the rainbow project. Before we move onto our last lesson, let&amp;rsquo;s review where we&amp;rsquo;re at;&#xA;An important distinction we need to make up front first is that in the past, we have introduced and used pull. While that is involved in what we&amp;rsquo;re about to learn, we&amp;rsquo;re going to go more specifically into pull requests, or a request to collaborate on work via a hosting service.</description>

      <description>There are mainly two types of ways to define sizes in CSS; absolute and relative. Absolute units are any measurement where the size will retain the same size no matter what; regardless of the other elements on screen, and screen size. The only absolute unit that should be in use is pixels, or px.&#xA;The other, relative, change based on a few factors. When using text, you&amp;rsquo;ll want to use rem or em, but most likely just rem.</description>

      <description>When progressing through the Odin Project, I went directly into the Full Stack JavaScript path, which started with SVGs and continues with Tables. I did see one topic I didn&amp;rsquo;t remember from the beginner path; flexboxes. My HTML is rusty, so I decided to read that article before hopping into tables. I thought why not combine them, since it was a quick read.&#xA;Essentially, flex is a way of organizing content on a web page so that it can be uniform and behavior is expected/controlled.</description>

      <description>SVGs is an image formatting type, known for its use in web design. It is used so commonly due to it being scalable (part of the name, Scalable Vector Graphics) and compatibility with CSS and JavaScript. Use cases range from icons to simple graphs and images, even backgrounds.&#xA;The main reason to use an SVG instead of a pixel based format would be the resolution not being so limiting. To increase the size of an image using what we call raster graphics would be stuck having to adjust for pixels not originally intended to be concerned with.</description>

      <description>Goal Start working on HTML/CSS changes Finish reformatting HTML with base.html Accomplishments Surprisingly, got a decent amount done in just under an hour. I was able to complete the base.html file, and worked out some of the kinks of the formatting. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t look exactly like the Figma yet, but I want to make sure all of the HTML files have the base.html extension first.&#xA;Problems or Issues Next: Day 23</description>

      <description>Rebasing We&amp;rsquo;re over ten chapters into this text; let&amp;rsquo;s get a quick recap of the status of our repos:&#xA;One thing to notice about the repos up until this point is that up to the green commit, our project&amp;rsquo;s history was linear. Some people prefer to keep their history this way, and want to avoid branching pathways, like we had to do for the three-way merges we had to make.</description>

      <description>Goal Get Calendly to prefill info for booking link Accomplishments I really thought todays goal was going to be harder, but it actually ended up being pretty easy. All I had to do was edit the URL and pass in some parameters. I thought maybe I&amp;rsquo;d have to set up a developer account and use JSON/JavaScript, but honestly it seems fine without it?&#xA;Problems or Issues Next: Day 22</description>

      <description>Goal Correctly sync the booking form to choose which type of session Caret drop down menu &amp;amp; link to appropriate function Small Tattoo Session Medium Tattoo Session Large Tattoo Session Small Tattoo Reschedule Medium Tattoo Reschedule Tattoo Touchup Accomplishments Got a ton done today; walked through the Figma with Big Boss and was able to get going on the layout. Promising results on that front shortly.&#xA;I was able to get the quick note I made down below finished pretty quick, and glad I did since that will help out immensely when I start building out the search/filter feature.</description>

      <description>Merge Conflicts In our last chapter, we were able to pull off our first three way merge without any issues. This time, we&amp;rsquo;re about to experience some merge conflicts, and what to do when we encounter them. You can view the end of Chapter 9 to see the visualization of where we&amp;rsquo;re at; we&amp;rsquo;ve got the M1 commit as the latest in all three repos.&#xA;One important distinction we need to make about this experiment we&amp;rsquo;re going to do versus the last chapter is the type of changes we&amp;rsquo;re going to make.</description>

      <description>Goal Finish the Figma for site Mess around on Calendly Accomplishments Finished the preliminary wireframe for the site, handed off to big boss So another rejection as far as my current layout for the site. I was able to get started and get an actual calendar embedded into the site which worked nicely. I now have a new slew of issues to worry about;&#xA;There are 3 types of bookings to account for Normal tattoo sessions, three types Small (&amp;gt;2hrs) Medium (2 - 5hrs) Large (5+hrs) Reschedules Small (2hrs) Medium (3hrs30) Touchups (1hr30) Change Admin&amp;rsquo;s booking page to choose which type of session Booking should generate and save a link to it in the SQLite database for use later Artist can send via dm with info already filled out Figure out how to give Calendly forms pre-saved information Problems or Issues Next: Day 20</description>

      <description>Goal Goals for today are quite simple; complete the look of the website on Figma, so the boss can come in and make design changes before I start committing any time towards building in HTML/CSS. I&amp;rsquo;m building out a basic skeleton for her to build off of, and I should be able to finish that today.&#xA;As far as the project is coming along, since we are moving away from using Full Calendar, I think we&amp;rsquo;re going to just integrate with Calendly.</description>

      <description>Goal First day back!&#xA;I was sick for maybe 2, 3 weeks? Probably the worst cold I&amp;rsquo;ve had in my life, and of course it happened in the midst of my 30 day challenge. I almost tried to work through it, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t focus at all and had to stop completely. Instead of calling it quits though, I&amp;rsquo;m going to start Day 17 over as a new day, and try and get back up on the saddle.</description>

      <description>Goal Honestly, I might be taking a small break today? I mostly wanted to get the ball rolling this week but after yesterday, I think I might have to settle for Calendly integration before trying to re-create their services. The Twilio account rejected my verification again, and after trying to build a working calendar system through JavaScript, I realized two things; I suck at JavaScript and don&amp;rsquo;t know what I&amp;rsquo;m doing, and Twilio has everything I&amp;rsquo;m looking for plus a little more.</description>

      <description>Goal From Yesterday:&#xA;Set up text message for request Client Artist Integrate with Google Calendar For Today:&#xA;Change calendar to full month and change the formatting Had a talk with the boss, and she wants it to look a little bit different than the week-hour grid I had going on. Instead, I need each date to be clickable when available, and when clicked, needs to open up a little window in front with the available times.</description>

      <description>Goal From Yesterday:&#xA;Accomplishments I looked more into Twilio and it seems like they have their own API that can be used to make sure it&amp;rsquo;s compliant with their rules. I&amp;rsquo;m going to try editing in a checkbox option that allows the user to check yes before submitting the application. If they don&amp;rsquo;t say yes, the database save will not include the phone number, save it as None, and text message reminders won&amp;rsquo;t be sent to them.</description>

I began as a book 4 hater; it felt like so much had been accomplished in the first three, what else could possibly happen to our cast of characters? Well, it turns out, a lot can happen and change, which is a recurring theme not only throughout this series, but especially in this one. Almost all of our main characters are going through internal and external factors that push them to make decisions, some life-altering, others not so much.</description>

      <description>Goal From Yesterday:&#xA;Format the Email back to client Accomplishments I didn&amp;rsquo;t get to work on this project much this weekend, and honestly I feel kind of okay about it? I am going to be putting off the AI roadmap on hold until this month is over to see if that helps with my workflow. This week I tried to do both and it left me really wanting to pick one over the other, so perhaps I&amp;rsquo;ll just leave the AI roadmap stuff on the back burner while I work hard on the next few days.</description>

      <description>As shown in one of the chapter 10 in the Python Tutorial, we can send emails over a built-in smtplib module that you can send emails with. You can find a basic example there. In wanting to implement a email to the tattoo booking app, I wanted to do a tutorial on how I can set it up so that emails are sent from the tattoo artist&amp;rsquo;s email address, so it would be easy for the client to respond.</description>

      <description>Link to article&#xA;Sorting Basics There are two basic ways we can ascending sort (organize from least to greatest on value) built into Python, .sort() on a list object, and the sorted() function, which takes in any iterable sequence.&#xA;sorted() will actually return the sequence in order, while .sort() is more of a step to be done, and will actually return None.&#xA;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; a = [3, 6, 1, 4] &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; sorted(a) [1, 3, 4, 6] &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; a.</description>

I created a really simple step-by-step guide to keep me on track, and to make the scope less creepy. I also was able to get a working schema for my tables, and I currently have user for Sarah, client for all people who book, and a requests for initial requests.</description>

      <description>Three Way Merges Every merge we&amp;rsquo;ve done so far has been a fast-forward merge. In this chapter, we&amp;rsquo;re going to take a look at performing our first three way merge, and also get some hands on experience with how editing our files out of order will affect our work flow. First, let&amp;rsquo;s simplify our visualization and update it to reflect where we left off in the last chapter;&#xA;Again, three way merges are important and necessary to understand.</description>

      <description>What is a Decorator? Essentially, a decorator, is a wrapping for function. It allows you to do something before and/or after a function is called. Let&amp;rsquo;s look at a super basic example;&#xA;def uppercase_word(function): def wrapper(): func = function() # call the function to get the return value make_upper = func.upper() return make_upper return wrapper Now, let&amp;rsquo;s say we make a really basic function to print text out;&#xA;def say_word(): return &amp;#34;say wooooord&amp;#34; We could print it out like this:</description>

      <description>Creating Tables One of the hardest things to do in data science (at least, to me) is pick up another person&amp;rsquo;s collected data. It will often take a few minutes of &amp;ldquo;getting calibrated&amp;rdquo; to understand the rows from simple things like understanding naming conventions (some are really bad) to more complex things like what story the data is telling.&#xA;The more complicated problems will end up needing some visualization tools which is something we&amp;rsquo;ll look at later, so for now let&amp;rsquo;s not think too big.</description>

      <description>Altering Tables If you need to include additional information not provided by the original tables creation statement, you can use an ALTER TABLE statement to manipulate and create columns.&#xA;Adding Columns Extremely similar to how we add in new rows, adding in a new column uses the following syntax:&#xA;ALTER TABLE mytable ADD column DataType OptionalTableConstraint DEFAULT default_value; We specify a table we want to add into, provide the column&amp;rsquo;s name and datatype, and we have the option for a table constraint and default value if needed.</description>

Essentially, a database is a place in which your data and tables exists, organized in a way described by the database schema.&#xA;There are many database platforms that use SQL as their main language; MySQL, NoSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, just to name a few.

      <description>Inserting Rows When we first started going over SQL databases, we just understood them as basic tables with columns of properties and rows of instances. The next step up is the Database Schema, which describes all tables in a database and the datatypes those rows can contain.&#xA;Because each row has defined types that are allowed, it keeps the database cleaner and easier to navigate.&#xA;Our first non-SELECT statement, we can start to insert data into our tables using the INSERT statement:</description>

      <description>Updating Rows If we can SELECT rows, and INSERT data into rows, we can most certainly UPDATE them as well.&#xA;UPDATE works similarly to INSERT, and needs a WHERE clause to specify which rows should be updated:&#xA;UPDATE mytable SET column = value_or_expression other_column = value_or_expression ... WHERE condition; Obviously, like INSERT, the values or expressions returned should match the data type of the expected column/property.&#xA;A helpful tip is to always try a SELECT statement out first to make sure you are grabbing all the rows you think you want before you make any changes.</description>

      <description>Queries with Aggregates Aggregates are analogous with built-in functions. They&amp;rsquo;re helpful pieces of code we can use to make writing our queries easier. The syntax is as follows:&#xA;SELECT AGG_FUNC(column_or_expression) AS agg_description FROM mytable WHERE constraint_expression; With the previous syntax, we would use said function over all rows and return a single result. Here are some functions we&amp;rsquo;ll use:&#xA;COUNT(column or *): returns the number of rows if no columns specified, otherwise returns number of non-NULL values in chosen column MIN(column): returns smallest numerical value for all rows in group MAX(column): returns largest numerical value for all rows in group AVG(column): returns average numerical value for all rows in group SUM(column): returns sum of all numerical values for all rows in the group There&amp;rsquo;s another concept we should look at called grouped aggregate functions, which instead of returning values for all rows, allows you to return multiple values based upon a specified delimiter or group.</description>

When getting unexpected output one of the first things you should check is your syntax and be sure you 100% know what you&amp;rsquo;re saying/what you expect to get back. If you aren&amp;rsquo;t writing complete or correct sentences, you&amp;rsquo;ll never get correct responses.&#xA;The following syntax is the complete structure for a query and is executed sequentially (one after the other):</description>

      <description>Queries with Expressions Now that we understand the basics of querying, we can really start to dive deeper by building more complex statements as expressions. These expressions can be mathematical or even basic string functions.&#xA;When writing expressions, we should use the AS keyword to create an alias for our expression, which makes our statements easier to read. This can be used on columns or tables.&#xA;The following statement is a great example of an expression:</description>

      <description>Outer Joins vs. Inner Joins Any table from an INNER JOIN will only contain information that belongs in BOTH tables. These can be limiting, which is where LEFT, RIGHT, and FULL JOIN&amp;rsquo;s come into the picture.&#xA;Our syntax for a standard expression doesn&amp;rsquo;t change, only get&amp;rsquo;s different options for our JOIN keyword.&#xA;SELECT column, another_table_column, ... FROM mytable INNER/LEFT/RIGHT/FULL JOIN another_table ON mytable.id = another_table.id WHERE condition(s) ORDER BY column, .</description>

      <description>NULL Values Unfortunately, working with data is an easy way to see that we don&amp;rsquo;t live in a perfect world. There are more than a few instances of there not being any data available to display, which can cause all sorts of issues with our queries. These values are what we call NULLS*, and can differ depending on your situation.&#xA;Most often at the start, we can leave them as NULL.</description>

      <description>Summations As we know, we analyze algorithms by their running time. When algorithms use for or while loops (iterative structures), the running time is expressed as the sum of all the times spent on execution.&#xA;Summation Formulas and Properties Say we have $a_1,a_2,&amp;hellip;a_n$ numbers, what we call a sequence. While $n$ is a non-negative integer, we can say the sum of that set is $\sum_{k=1}^{n}a_k$.&#xA;If $n=0$, value is 0.</description>

      <description>Characterizing Running Times As we saw in Chapter 2, order of growth gives us the ability to quantify the effectiveness of our algorithms, and compare them.&#xA;Us studying these algorithms at large enough input sizes is us studying the asymptotic efficiency of an algorithm. We can say an algorithm that is &amp;ldquo;more asymptotically efficient&amp;rdquo; is the better choice for most cases, save small inputs.&#xA;O-notation, $\Theta$-notation, and $\Omega$-notation We already met $\Theta$-notation in chapter 2; this is a type of asymptotic notation.</description>

      <description>Hosting Services and Authentication Everything we&amp;rsquo;ve done up until this point has been local. Even though some of the things we&amp;rsquo;ve looked at incentive&amp;rsquo;s working in a group, if your repository is local no one else will have access to it. This is where public repositories come into play.&#xA;There are three main players in the repository game; GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket. I personally only have experience with GitHub, so we&amp;rsquo;ll be focusing on that going forward.</description>

You should also refer to this to get a fundamental understanding of the reasons why we&amp;rsquo;d want to use ndarray in the first place.&#xA;What are we doing this lesson then? We&amp;rsquo;re going to learn about what one, two, and $n$ dimensional arrays actually are, some algebra operations on ndarray objects without for loops, and even more advanced things like what axis and shape properties are.</description>

      <description>Filtering and Sorting Results One way to ensure we don&amp;rsquo;t get duplicate rows, we could use the DISTINCT keyword;&#xA;SELECT DISTINCT column, another_column, ... FROM mytable WHERE condition(s); This however is pretty indiscriminate, and we&amp;rsquo;ll look at how to specify duplicates with GROUP BY later.&#xA;Often in the real world, our data is not going to be ordered nice and neatly. Quite often, data is inserted without rhyme or reason, and purely based off when some events happened and collected rather than compared to the rest of the data in the data set.</description>

      <description>Multi-table Queries with JOINs Unlike the database we&amp;rsquo;ve been using for most of these lessons, real world data is usually divided into different tables, often through a process we call normalization. Normalization is the procedure used to break down large tables into smaller more organic tables. This reduces duplicate data, and allows for a more natural growth of data within respective tables.&#xA;Due to our data being broken up, our queries will in turn have to become more complex to grab information over multiple tables.</description>

      <description>Specifying Data to Select (Constraints) When our table has only a few rows, a select * query isn&amp;rsquo;t so bad. However, if we have hundreds, sometimes thousands of rows of data, retrieving all of them at once becomes an issue.&#xA;That reason is why we have the ability to specify our results with conditional statements:&#xA;SELECT column, another_column, ... FROM mytable WHERE condition AND/OR another_condition AND/OR ...; We can collect more complex results from building more complex queries.</description>

      <description>Question: Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears more than once in the array, otherwise return false.&#xA;How to Solve: We can create a secondary list that we can start to throw the values from our array nums into, and check to see if they already exist in the list or not. As soon as we enter a number that already exists in our list, it will return True and end.</description>

      <description>Question: Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return the indices i and j such that nums[i] + nums[j] == target and i != j.&#xA;You may assume that every input has exactly one pair of indices i and j that satisfy the condition.&#xA;Return the answer with the smaller index first.&#xA;How to Solve: We can use a two pointer approach with i and j. First, we set up a for loop that will iterate j from the length of the array to the first position.</description>

      <description>Question: Given two strings s and t, return true if the two strings are anagrams of each other, otherwise return false.&#xA;An anagram is a string that contains the exact same characters as another string, but the order of the characters can be different.&#xA;How to Solve: We essentially need to compare two strings and see if the amount of characters are the same for each word. There are probably a few ways to do that, but I went for the extremely direct approach.</description>

More so because I didn&amp;rsquo;t love Lift as a character. I was actually going to say I didn&amp;rsquo;t hate their childish behavior, but typing that out I had a gut feeling I wasn&amp;rsquo;t being honest with myself.&#xA;I really didn&amp;rsquo;t like how childish Lift was. Maybe that was her point, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to grasp onto the story.</description>

      <description>When we want to get information for a SQL table, we use the SELECT statement, or a query. Within a query is what data we want, where to get it from, and any additional formatting we want done before we get said data.&#xA;When selecting information from a table, we have to understand the make-up of a table. Let&amp;rsquo;s say we have a reptiles table. There might be different types of reptiles (snakes, lizards, turtles, crocodiles) but each reptile has characteristics that make it unique.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if it&amp;rsquo;s obvious to everyone, but as a teacher I noticed that students do not know how to take notes. At best a student is writing something down, albeit not very good notes. Most are not taking any notes at all.&#xA;This is a small band-aid fix, but I&amp;rsquo;m going to start implementing Obsidian as a minor section of my curriculum this year. Online notes are not a replacement for good handwritten note-taking, but for my Computer Science Honors kids it&amp;rsquo;s a good place to store code from lessons and start to think about what&amp;rsquo;s really important.</description>

No mind blowing innovation going on, and certainly nothing I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen before, nevertheless gratifying to bring together.&#xA;The most frustrating issue was that the configuration for running setting up the llama model in Poetry was either wrong on the tutorial or my machine is weird.</description>

      <description>Making a Commit We left off with our first text file in our working directory, our rainbowcolors.txt file. It has one sentence in it, and we can check that by either opening it or running cat rainbowcolors.txt in the working directory. We can see that we haven&amp;rsquo;t made any commits yet, and we only have one untracked file. You can run git status to gather all of this info.</description>

      <description>Where We Left Off I was just able to get my website viewable for the first time in Hugo&amp;rsquo;s draft view. I worked through the formatting errors that my Hugo theme wasn&amp;rsquo;t compatible with, and everything is looking good.&#xA;Implementing Git was also incredibly simple. If you don&amp;rsquo;t know anything about Git, you can start by reading my analysis of a beginner Git textbook. Since Hugo requires you using a separate directory for content, just initialize a new repo in your directory, connect it to a GitHub repo, and you&amp;rsquo;re off to the races.</description>

      <description>Local Repositories Introducing and Initializing a Local Repository A repository (or a repo) is the container of a project version controlled by Git. There are two; local and remote. Local is stored on your computer, while remote is obviously hosted remotely (someone else&amp;rsquo;s computer).&#xA;GitHub is one of the largest platforms and the one I&amp;rsquo;m most familiar with. GitLab and Bitbucket also exist, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t used them myself. Chapter 6 onward deals with this; for now, we can worry about it later.</description>

      <description>Git and the Command Line What is Git? Git is a version control system that keeps track of the changes done to a project or directory. When you edit a file, Git records what was added and removed. If files are added or removed, Git has it&amp;rsquo;s eyes on it (if you&amp;rsquo;re configuring it correctly).&#xA;Git was originally created by Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux. Meant to be used at the command line, it is clearly more complex then a simply saving a file.</description>

Grow up into being one of the most meh pieces of work I&amp;rsquo;ve ever followed.&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s hard to even think of where My Hero fell off for me. I want to say it was watching alongside the anime and not really loving it, to around the time Deku started to gain more powers, nothing ever really felt memorable enough to make me want to catch up.</description>

      <description>Unit 2: The Internet The internet is a global connection of computers communicating with one another. The constant flow of input and output keeps the internet going.&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s an open system, meaning anyone can join given they follow the proper protocols. These include but aren&amp;rsquo;t limited too:&#xA;IP: Protocol for identifying IP addresses with some routing strategy to send and receive information TCP/UDP: Protocols that transfer packets of data that check for errors along the route TLS: Protocol for encrypting data HTTP &amp;amp; DNS: Protocols for internet browsers Even though we likely use the internet everyday, a lot of these protocols are so far abstracted that we hardly have to think about these.</description>

      <description>Community Plugins Community plugins keep some pieces of software alive. When development stops on a product, often the users can keep producing forks of the initial project and continue developing their own functions and uses for the app. In Obsidian&amp;rsquo;s case, even while production is still going, they implore users to develop their own plugins to meet their own needs.&#xA;One thing should be stressed; community plugins should only be prioritized after learning the ins and outs of core Obsidian.</description>

      <description>Modified: July 19 2024&#xA;Link to video.&#xA;The Basics of Shell Shell, terminal, console, command line, all are essentially the same thing.&#xA;Commands ls: lists out all items in the current (target) directory You can pass some flags to change the output -latrh will produce long list format, all files, sorted by time, in reverse, with human readable file sizes You can also use a path as an argument, as well as a combination of both flags and path cd: change directory pwd: shows path to current work directory echo: lets you print some text cat: lets you print the content of a file touch: creates a file if it doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist; changes the timestamp if it does cp: lets you copy a file or directory to a target destination move: like copy, but moves it instead rm: removes a file or directory Need to use -r to delete a directory You can add f to forcefully delete it ln: creates a symlink in a file to another location Similar to a reference object in programming less: lets you view text content in a scrollable format Often more useful than cat, since you can search easily more: less than less, but more on the screen and can only go forward man: shows the manual for the command you need Similar to using --help after a command One documentation I&amp;rsquo;d love to go through is note taking manual pages for all these commands.</description>

One Python install might not suffice for most applications.&#xA;To circumnavigate this, we create virtual environments, that act as self-contained directories with an installation of Python, and any number of packages.&#xA;12.2 Creating Virtual Environments We can use the venv module to create and manage our own virtual environment.</description>

      <description>Modified: July 03 2024&#xA;7/3/2024&#xA;Taken from this article.&#xA;Often in projects, we want to format our large float types as smaller percentages.&#xA;There are three main ways to do this:&#xA;Rounding and Float/String Types: round() takes two parameters: a value and a number to round too. Then, we can use a little complicated string statement.&#xA;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; number = 0.8839133112 &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; n2 = round(number, 4) &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print(n2) 0.886 &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print(str(n2 * 100) + &amp;#39;%&amp;#39;) Format() Alternatively, if that seems a bit complicated, we can just format() instead.</description>

I enjoyed tackling such a huge tome of a novel.&#xA;The characters were awesome, even if I felt like the interlude characters could have been longer to make them a bit more memorable.</description>

      <description>Link to documentation&#xA;What is NumPy? Python lists are great- easy to use, easy to understand, and perfect for quick one-and-done scenarios. However, there is a huge downside to lists. In most cases, since lists can accept any data type by default, this leaves lists open to unexpected data types you might not want around your list data.&#xA;NumPy is a solution to this issue, specifically in the realm of scientific computing.</description>
