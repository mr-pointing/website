      <description>Modified: July 19 2024&#xA;Link to video.&#xA;Can be faster than creating a regular class.&#xA;How classes are typically written:&#xA;class Fruit: def __init__(self, name: str, calories: float): self.name = name self.calories = calories banana = Fruit(&amp;#39;Banana&amp;#39;, 10) We can do the same with a dataclass:&#xA;from dataclasses import dataclass @dataclass class Fruit: name: str calories: float banana = Fruit(&amp;#39;Banana&amp;#39;, 10) With the first example, we wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to print it nicely without writing a __str__ representation, but here, we can print out banana and get Fruit(name=&#39;Banana&#39;, calories=10), which looks much nicer.</description>

      <description>Modified: July 19 2024&#xA;Lython is my final project for my Masters program. I based it off an idea I had of giving my students a filtered AI, which branched off into editing ChatGPT with prompt filtering. Seeing that alone was particularly easy, I looked into implementing RAG, which works kind of.&#xA;Github&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;d like to continue working on my project as an actual tool to use during class. I&amp;rsquo;d like to be able to launch it to a production server, so my students can access it during class.</description>

      <description>Modified: July 23 2024&#xA;Link to video.&#xA;Tip 1: Do one thing, and do it well A function should perform a single task.&#xA;Think about the level of abstraction; the function should be on the same level of abstraction.&#xA;He brings up two examples, one of a function that iterates through a collection, checking each value against a matcher to return if one exists. He says this has two levels of abstraction; the iteration, and the comparison.</description>

      <description>Modified: July 19 2024&#xA;Virtual Environments and Packages 12.1 Introduction Often, you&amp;rsquo;re going to need tools and modules that aren&amp;rsquo;t included with Python by default, or in your standard library. One Python install might not suffice for most applications.&#xA;To circumnavigate this, we create virtual environments, that act as self-contained directories with an installation of Python, and any number of packages.&#xA;12.2 Creating Virtual Environments We can use the venv module to create and manage our own virtual environment.</description>

      <description>Modified: July 03 2024&#xA;7/3/2024&#xA;Taken from this article.&#xA;Often in projects, we want to format our large float types as smaller percentages.&#xA;There are three main ways to do this:&#xA;Rounding and Float/String Types: round() takes two parameters: a value and a number to round too. Then, we can use a little complicated string statement.&#xA;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; number = 0.8839133112 &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; n2 = round(number, 4) &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print(n2) 0.886 &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print(str(n2 * 100) + &amp;#39;%&amp;#39;) Format() Alternatively, if that seems a bit complicated, we can just format() instead.</description>

      <description>Modified: July 19 2024&#xA;Classes 6/28/2024&#xA;Classes combine data storage and functionality into one package. When you make a new class, you are making a new type of object. A new instance, or occurrence of that type are able to be made using function call of the class.&#xA;A class is made up of attributes and methods defined by the classes definition.&#xA;Python classes follow closely to other Object Oriented Programming languages classes in the following ways:</description>

      <description>Modified: July 19 2024&#xA;Errors and Exceptions 6/22/2024&#xA;There are two distinguishable types of errors: syntax errors and exceptions.&#xA;8.1 Syntax Syntax errors (or parsing errors) are errors involving the actual use of the language.&#xA;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; while True print(&amp;#39;Hello World&amp;#39;) File &amp;#34;&amp;lt;stdin&amp;gt;&amp;#34;, line 1 while True print(&amp;#39;Hello world&amp;#39;) ^^^^^ SyntaxError: invalid syntax In the example above, the while statement is missing the : required to use it.&#xA;8.2 Exceptions Even if code is syntactically correct, an error may occur when attempting to execute it.</description>

      <description>Modified: August 02 2024&#xA;Watched this video to take some notes on what REST is.&#xA;API: Application Programming Interface, is how to computers can communicate with each other.&#xA;Client sends a Request to the server, server sends a response back to the client.&#xA;REST, or Representational State Transfer, is the most popular way to communicate with these web servers.&#xA;REST is actually a set of rules and standards. Any API that follows the REST rules is known as a RESTful API.</description>

      <description>Modified: July 19 2024&#xA;Input and Output 6/18/2024&#xA;There are three main ways to present output in Python; expression statements (not using print()), using print(), and using write() which writes something into an existing or new file.&#xA;7.1 Fancier Output Formatting At any point in the command line, I can just send out some text without any print() commands and get back what I just sent in. That&amp;rsquo;s an expression statement.</description>

This is why we write scripts.&#xA;Python has the ability to writes scripts, or another method called modules. Definitions from modules can be imported into your instance of Python.&#xA;Main is also given a definition here: the collection of variables that you have access to in a script executed at the top level and in calculator mode.</description>
