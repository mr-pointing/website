      <description>TCP/IP and the Five Layer Network Model Below is a basic table outlining the five layers:&#xA;Layer Name Protocol Protocol Data Unit Addressing Application HTTP, SMTP, etc. Messages n/a Transport TCP/UDP Segment Port #&amp;rsquo;s Network IP Packet/Datagram IP Addresses Data Link Ethernet, Wi-Fi Frames MAC Address Physical n/a Bits n/a Physical Layer: The actual computing device(s) and the cables that connect them, sends and receives signals Data Link Layer: Also known as the network access layer, it&amp;rsquo;s our first protocol to interpret signals sent from and to each computing device Ethernet is our first and most common protocol, which is responsible for transporting data across the network Network Layer: Also know as the internet layer, this layer is what actually allows the computing devices to communicate with each other.</description>

      <description>I started this Corsera course in hopes of getting a certification (and that helping me get a job). I&amp;rsquo;m going to assume it&amp;rsquo;s similar to Khan Academy&amp;rsquo;s courses, but we&amp;rsquo;ll find out if completing it helps or not after the fact.&#xA;What is IT Support? The people behind the scenes helping Information Technology (IT) run and troubleshoot issues. Digital literacy is the &amp;ldquo;defining factor&amp;rdquo; that makes a good IT support technician.</description>

      <description>Unit 2: The Internet The internet is a global connection of computers communicating with one another. The constant flow of input and output keeps the internet going.&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s an open system, meaning anyone can join given they follow the proper protocols. These include but aren&amp;rsquo;t limited too:&#xA;IP: Protocol for identifying IP addresses with some routing strategy to send and receive information TCP/UDP: Protocols that transfer packets of data that check for errors along the route TLS: Protocol for encrypting data HTTP &amp;amp; DNS: Protocols for internet browsers Even though we likely use the internet everyday, a lot of these protocols are so far abstracted that we hardly have to think about these.</description>

      <description>Unit 1: Digital Information Most of this I should know, being a computer science teacher. However, outlining this should make teaching this rather boring portion easier. I want to try implementing more diagrams while I teach; I&amp;rsquo;ll be looking forward to stealing their ideas.&#xA;Bits and bytes How do computers represent data? All computers understand is Binary, 0&amp;rsquo;s and 1&amp;rsquo;s.&#xA;The video explains the example of using one single wire to transfer electricity through it; on or off.</description>

      <description>Modified: July 19 2024&#xA;Link to video.&#xA;Request/Response Cycle It&amp;rsquo;s like a conversation. Client and server advertise capabilities and supported formats to one another.&#xA;HTTP is stateless, but the implementation will do state like things like caching. You need to see both sides of the conversation.&#xA;Anatomy of a request GET / HTTP/1.1 Host: localhost:8001 Request body. Anatomy of a response HTTP/1.0 200 OK X-Headers: Here Response body. Request headers Sent automatically&amp;hellip;when not doing Ajax</description>

      <title>Designing a RESTful API</title>

      <description>Modified: August 02 2024&#xA;Watched this video to take some notes on what REST is.&#xA;API: Application Programming Interface, is how to computers can communicate with each other.&#xA;Client sends a Request to the server, server sends a response back to the client.&#xA;REST, or Representational State Transfer, is the most popular way to communicate with these web servers.&#xA;REST is actually a set of rules and standards. Any API that follows the REST rules is known as a RESTful API.</description>
