      <description>If this had a proper ending, it might have gone down as one of my favorite manga of all time. Unfortunately, it&amp;rsquo;ll have to settle for one of the best.&#xA;I really enjoyed reading Hikaru No Go, mostly for Sai and because I will most likely never play or get into Go. Just shown here, with how little attention they give to explaining how the game really works, go to show how complex Go can be.</description>

      <description>by Kohei Horikoshi 2014 - 2024&#xA;Ah man. Ten years of My Hero. Crazy to think of where I was at 10 years ago, in High School myself, seeing these characters grow. Grow up into being one of the most meh pieces of work I&amp;rsquo;ve ever followed.&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s hard to even think of where My Hero fell off for me. I want to say it was watching alongside the anime and not really loving it, to around the time Deku started to gain more powers, nothing ever really felt memorable enough to make me want to catch up.</description>

      <description>Modified: August 02 2024&#xA;by Masashi Kishimoto 1999 - 2014&#xA;I finished Naruto today. I really enjoyed reading it; I nearly flew through it in just over or under 3 months. I had a blast-Kishimoto&amp;rsquo;s art was really fun and emotive and kept me wanting to see just how each page would grow in more detail and impact. I think it delivered in that respect. The last 100 chapters had many great panels-none screenshot worthy in my opinion like the beginning/middle of the series but regardless a lot of fun.</description>
