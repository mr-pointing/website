      <description>Where We Left Off I was just able to get my website viewable for the first time in Hugo&amp;rsquo;s draft view. I worked through the formatting errors that my Hugo theme wasn&amp;rsquo;t compatible with, and everything is looking good.&#xA;Implementing Git was also incredibly simple. If you don&amp;rsquo;t know anything about Git, you can start by reading my analysis of a beginner Git textbook. Since Hugo requires you using a separate directory for content, just initialize a new repo in your directory, connect it to a GitHub repo, and you&amp;rsquo;re off to the races.</description>

      <description>Quick Start It&amp;rsquo;s remarkably easy to start using Hugo. So much so it makes me want to start working on my portfolio immediately.&#xA;To start, we need to use PowerShell instead of Windows PowerShell.
