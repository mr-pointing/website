      <description>Link to the project.&#xA;This really tested my time and patience. What should have taken me an hour took me closer to a day, but it was extremely worth the time investment. No mind blowing innovation going on, and certainly nothing I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen before, nevertheless gratifying to bring together.&#xA;The most frustrating issue was that the configuration for running setting up the llama model in Poetry was either wrong on the tutorial or my machine is weird.</description>

      <description>Lython is my final project for my Masters program. I based it off an idea I had of giving my students a filtered AI, which branched off into editing ChatGPT with prompt filtering. Seeing that alone was particularly easy, I looked into implementing RAG, which works kind of.&#xA;Github&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;d like to continue working on my project as an actual tool to use during class. I&amp;rsquo;d like to be able to launch it to a production server, so my students can access it during class.</description>

      <description>A resource by Code Basics&#xA;We&amp;rsquo;ll see how this works. Starting in June of 2024, I plan to get myself prepared for a new career after another year of teaching. Pretty much; I want to find a job ideally that starts in the late summer of next year.&#xA;Week 0 is stupid lol.&#xA;Week 1 and 2 (6/2 - 6/17) I have a masters degree in this subject. I think I can handle a khan academy course and going through the entire Python documentation in two weeks.</description>
