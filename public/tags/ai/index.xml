      <description>Linear Algebra This book covers all topics of linear algebra that are important to deep learning, not necessarily all topics within Linear Algebra. For a text more focused in linear algebra, see here.&#xA;Scalars, Vectors, Matrices, and Tensors Scalars Single numbers, usually denoted by a lowercase variable name, and introduced with some information on the number.&#xA;Ex.&#xA;Let $$s \in R$$ be the slope of the line for a real-valued scalar Let $$n \in N$$ be the number of units for a natural number scalar Vectors An ordered array of numbers, obtainable via the index position of the number in the array.</description>

      <description>Preface MIT Press Online Edition Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville Link to the book.&#xA;Chapter 1 Introduction This book is intended to prepare you for concepts and theory used in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, more specifically deep learning, or the multi-layered stacked concepts that make up the intelligence of an AI model.&#xA;Like most textbooks, it goes into the why of AI, and what they do best; solving problems that humans are generally not good at.</description>

      <description>Link to the project.&#xA;This really tested my time and patience. What should have taken me an hour took me closer to a day, but it was extremely worth the time investment. No mind blowing innovation going on, and certainly nothing I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen before, nevertheless gratifying to bring together.&#xA;The most frustrating issue was that the configuration for running setting up the llama model in Poetry was either wrong on the tutorial or my machine is weird.</description>

      <description>Lython is my final project for my Masters program. I based it off an idea I had of giving my students a filtered AI, which branched off into editing ChatGPT with prompt filtering. Seeing that alone was particularly easy, I looked into implementing RAG, which works kind of.&#xA;Github&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;d like to continue working on my project as an actual tool to use during class. I&amp;rsquo;d like to be able to launch it to a production server, so my students can access it during class.</description>

      <description>A resource by Code Basics&#xA;We&amp;rsquo;ll see how this works. Starting in June of 2024, I plan to get myself prepared for a new career after another year of teaching. Pretty much; I want to find a job ideally that starts in the late summer of next year.&#xA;Week 0 is stupid lol.&#xA;Week 1 and 2 (6/2 - 6/17) I have a masters degree in this subject. I think I can handle a khan academy course and going through the entire Python documentation in two weeks.</description>
