Lython is my final project for my Masters program. I based it off an idea I had of giving my students a filtered AI, which branched off into editing ChatGPT with prompt filtering. Seeing that alone was particularly easy, I looked into implementing RAG, which works kind of.

I&amp;rsquo;d like to continue working on my project as an actual tool to use during class. I&amp;rsquo;d like to be able to launch it to a production server, so my students can access it during class.</description></item><item><title>AI Engineer Roadmap</title><link>http://localhost:1313/posts/computer-science/ai-engineer-roadmap/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/computer-science/ai-engineer-roadmap/</guid><description>Modified: August 02 2024

We&amp;rsquo;ll see how this works. Starting in June of 2024, I plan to get myself prepared for a new career after another year of teaching. Pretty much; I want to find a job ideally that starts in the late summer of next year.
Week 0 is stupid lol.
Week 1 and 2 (6/2 - 6/17) I have a masters degree in this subject.</description></item></channel></rss>
