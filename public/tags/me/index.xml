      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if it&amp;rsquo;s obvious to everyone, but as a teacher I noticed that students do not know how to take notes. At best a student is writing something down, albeit not very good notes. Most are not taking any notes at all.&#xA;This is a small band-aid fix, but I&amp;rsquo;m going to start implementing Obsidian as a minor section of my curriculum this year. Online notes are not a replacement for good handwritten note-taking, but for my Computer Science Honors kids it&amp;rsquo;s a good place to store code from lessons and start to think about what&amp;rsquo;s really important.</description>

      <description>Who I Am My name is Richard Pointing, a computer science teacher based in Brooklyn, New York. I recently graduated with a Masters in Computer Science, with a focus in Machine Learning and AI.&#xA;My focus is in Python, but I&amp;rsquo;ve recently been trying to dip my feet in Bash and getting comfortable in Linux. This website is a test to see if I can start doing more things myself (choosing to use Hugo instead of Obsidian Publish).</description>
