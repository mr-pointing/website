      <description>&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What began as a search for a birthday gift for my mother, became a dive deep into the life of Jeannette Walls. In true Richie fashion, I picked the biggest downer I could&amp;rsquo;ve picked for a happy birthday. Knowing nothing about the book, I had saw it a few times show up as a &amp;ldquo;BookTok&amp;rdquo; recommendation, and even appear on my mom&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Want to Read&amp;rdquo; list on her Goodreads account. Knowing that there was a book in common the both of us wanted to read, I didn&amp;rsquo;t even bother reading the back before purchasing and gifting it to her.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
