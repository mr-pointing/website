      <description>Modified: July 19 2024&#xA;Link to video.&#xA;Building a Homelab is easier and more affordable than ever before.&#xA;You can start homelabbing with extra tech or cloud options.&#xA;Clustering, through something like Kubernetes, you can start small. One small machine, and expand as you grow. All you need is a command line and 2gb of RAM.&#xA;Self hosting might need something more stable.&#xA;One way to start is with an old laptop.</description>

      <description>Modified: July 19 2024&#xA;Link to video.&#xA;The Basics of Shell Shell, terminal, console, command line, all are essentially the same thing.&#xA;Commands ls: lists out all items in the current (target) directory You can pass some flags to change the output -latrh will produce long list format, all files, sorted by time, in reverse, with human readable file sizes You can also use a path as an argument, as well as a combination of both flags and path cd: change directory pwd: shows path to current work directory echo: lets you print some text cat: lets you print the content of a file touch: creates a file if it doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist; changes the timestamp if it does cp: lets you copy a file or directory to a target destination move: like copy, but moves it instead rm: removes a file or directory Need to use -r to delete a directory You can add f to forcefully delete it ln: creates a symlink in a file to another location Similar to a reference object in programming less: lets you view text content in a scrollable format Often more useful than cat, since you can search easily more: less than less, but more on the screen and can only go forward man: shows the manual for the command you need Similar to using --help after a command One documentation I&amp;rsquo;d love to go through is note taking manual pages for all these commands.</description>
