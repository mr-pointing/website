Getting Sorted This chapter is meant to familiarize yourself with the framework used throughout the book.
2.1 Insertion Sort Solves a sorting problem (obviously).
The numbers to be sorted are known as keys.
The input comes in the form of an array with $n$ elements.
A reason to sort is often because those keys are associated with other data, Satellite data.
Key + Satellite = Record</description></item><item><title>Introduction to Algorithms - Preface</title><link>http://localhost:1313/posts/computer-science/introduction-to-algorithms/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/computer-science/introduction-to-algorithms/</guid><description>Created: July 17 2024 Modified: August 02 2024
Fourth Edition Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, Clifford Stein Preface Algorithms are everywhere, apart of almost everything we do, and every decision we make. They are part of most if not all tech stacks used today.
Each chapter in this book will present an algorithm, an application area for some algorithm, or some other related topic.
For teaching purposes The less complex the audience, the less complex chapters you need.</description></item><item><title>Introduction to Algorithms - Chapter 1</title><link>http://localhost:1313/posts/computer-science/introduction-to-algorithms/part-1/introduction-to-algorithms---chapter-1/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/computer-science/introduction-to-algorithms/part-1/introduction-to-algorithms---chapter-1/</guid><description>Modified: August 02 2024
The Role of Algorithms in Computing 1.1 Algorithms Algorithm: Any well defined computational procedure that takes some value, or set of values, as input and produces some value, or set of values, as output in a finite amount of time.
We often say algorithms help us solve computational problems.
We can define a sorting algorithm like so: Input: A sequence of n numbers, ${a_1, a_2, &amp;hellip; a_n}$ Output: A permutation (reordering) ${a_1,a_2,&amp;hellip;a_n}$ of the input sequence such that $a_1 &amp;lt;= a_2 &amp;lt;= .</description></item><item><title>Introduction to Algorithms - Part 1</title><link>http://localhost:1313/posts/computer-science/introduction-to-algorithms/part-1/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/computer-science/introduction-to-algorithms/part-1/</guid><description>Modified: August 02 2024
