      <description>&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A philosophical endeavor to say the least, Thus Spoke Zarathustra was a tough read and an enlightening one. To start, this is a book I&amp;rsquo;ve owned for many years. As a teenager, I had only a cursory understanding of who Nietzsche was, and was angsty/thought he had all the answers to my questions. It was exactly the opposite; I thought I knew what he was talking about, but I had not even a hint of a clue.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
