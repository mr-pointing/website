One thing that I&amp;rsquo;m trying to to stress is the prettification of all of my elements. I got the emails working, but they look like crap.</description>

      <description>Goal From Yesterday:&#xA;Format the Email back to client Accomplishments I didn&amp;rsquo;t get to work on this project much this weekend, and honestly I feel kind of okay about it? I am going to be putting off the AI roadmap on hold until this month is over to see if that helps with my workflow. This week I tried to do both and it left me really wanting to pick one over the other, so perhaps I&amp;rsquo;ll just leave the AI roadmap stuff on the back burner while I work hard on the next few days.</description>

      <description>Goal From yesterday:&#xA;Test email sending/receiving Format the Email back to client Accomplishments Today was a very busy work day, so I really didn&amp;rsquo;t get that far on anything. The biggest thing I did was I was able to locate the right documentation to help out with the next few steps. Otherwise, not a whole lot got done today.&#xA;Problems or Issues When running the Gmail quickstart code, I neglected to realize you would need to change the SCOPE list variable to allow more authorizations.</description>

      <description>Link to tutorial.&#xA;I was really hesitant to start this note, since I basically ran through this tutorial once already to start and complete my final project, Lython. However, since I&amp;rsquo;m starting Sarah&amp;rsquo;s site, and I want to test out a bunch of features/really get to understand Flask, let&amp;rsquo;s go through it once more.&#xA;Last time, I did a combination of going through the tutorial, then making changes as I saw fit.</description>

      <description>Lython is my final project for my Masters program. I based it off an idea I had of giving my students a filtered AI, which branched off into editing ChatGPT with prompt filtering. Seeing that alone was particularly easy, I looked into implementing RAG, which works kind of.&#xA;Github&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;d like to continue working on my project as an actual tool to use during class. I&amp;rsquo;d like to be able to launch it to a production server, so my students can access it during class.</description>

      <description>Modified: August 02 2024&#xA;Watched this video to take some notes on what REST is.&#xA;API: Application Programming Interface, is how to computers can communicate with each other.&#xA;Client sends a Request to the server, server sends a response back to the client.&#xA;REST, or Representational State Transfer, is the most popular way to communicate with these web servers.&#xA;REST is actually a set of rules and standards. Any API that follows the REST rules is known as a RESTful API.</description>
