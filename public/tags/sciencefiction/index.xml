      <title>The Man in the High Castle</title>

      <description>&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another killer Philip K. Dick piece, and although not my favorite from him, a quick and compelling read. What I got most out of this &amp;ldquo;new&amp;rdquo; America was the constant fear about the self-the fear of losing your identity, or the fear of your identity aligning with your perceived identity. Majority of the characters come face to face with outward-adversity, but only briefly. For most of the book the characters are just trying to exist in a society where identity is everything and means absolutely nothing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Not remembering much from my initial watch of Blade Runner, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure what to expect going into this one. I did really enjoy A Scanner Darkly by Dick, so I expected to like this one despite not knowing much. I was not disappointed, and after blowing through this in 2 days I can say I really enjoyed it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The philosophical questions presented combined with the loose answers they provide were interesting and engaging enough for me to think about throughout the read. Trying to find the meaning for the actions and motivations of the characters, just to be given a major thematic question of &amp;ldquo;Should we assign meaning to meaningless things&amp;rdquo; halfway through got me good.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Road</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Modified: July 14 2024&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I finished The Road a few days ago and I&amp;rsquo;ve reflected fondly on the experience. Slow burn isn&amp;rsquo;t the word I&amp;rsquo;d use; perhaps a slow agonizing death. Because by the end, I was emotionally exhausted. It asks a lot of you. Sit through the gray, dim world that the story takes place in. Hope to some God the end is worth it. In my opinion, I think it was.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
