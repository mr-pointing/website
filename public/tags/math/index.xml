      <description>Probability and Information Theory When we encounter situations where the output is unknown, probability theory gives us a mathematical framework to deal with these statements. They use the term &amp;ldquo;quantifying uncertainty&amp;rdquo; which I like a lot. The connection between AI applications and probability come from two places; algorithms often use probability theory to give AI it&amp;rsquo;s reasoning abilities, and probability with statistics are used to grade and categorize the behavior of the AI models/agents.</description>

      <description>Linear Algebra This book covers all topics of linear algebra that are important to deep learning, not necessarily all topics within Linear Algebra. For a text more focused in linear algebra, see here.&#xA;Scalars, Vectors, Matrices, and Tensors Scalars Single numbers, usually denoted by a lowercase variable name, and introduced with some information on the number.&#xA;Ex.&#xA;Let $s \in R$ be the slope of the line for a real-valued scalar Let $n \in N$ be the number of units for a natural number scalar Vectors An ordered array of numbers, obtainable via the index position of the number in the array.</description>
