      <description>Linear Algebra This book covers all topics of linear algebra that are important to deep learning, not necessarily all topics within Linear Algebra. For a text more focused in linear algebra, see here.&#xA;Scalars, Vectors, Matrices, and Tensors Scalars Single numbers, usually denoted by a lowercase variable name, and introduced with some information on the number.&#xA;Ex.&#xA;Let $$s \in R$$ be the slope of the line for a real-valued scalar Let $$n \in N$$ be the number of units for a natural number scalar Vectors An ordered array of numbers, obtainable via the index position of the number in the array.</description>

      <description>Preface MIT Press Online Edition Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville Link to the book.&#xA;Chapter 1 Introduction This book is intended to prepare you for concepts and theory used in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, more specifically deep learning, or the multi-layered stacked concepts that make up the intelligence of an AI model.&#xA;Like most textbooks, it goes into the why of AI, and what they do best; solving problems that humans are generally not good at.</description>

      <description>Creating and Pushing to a Remote Repository Currently, we have three commits, red, orange, and yellow. We have two branches, both of them (head and feature) pointing at our yellow commit, and HEAD is attached to main.&#xA;Now that we&amp;rsquo;re beginning to talk about remote repositories, it&amp;rsquo;s important to understand how these projects are started. We&amp;rsquo;ve been working on our Rainbow project, which we know is a local repository.</description>

      <description>Summations As we know, we analyze algorithms by their running time. When algorithms use for or while loops (iterative structures), the running time is expressed as the sum of all the times spent on execution.&#xA;Summation Formulas and Properties Say we have $a_1,a_2,&amp;hellip;a_n$ numbers, what we call a sequence. While $n$ is a non-negative integer, we can say the sum of that set is $\sum_{k=1}^{n}a_k$.&#xA;If $n=0$, value is 0.</description>

      <description>Created: July 17 2024 Modified: August 02 2024&#xA;Fourth Edition Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, Clifford Stein Preface Algorithms are everywhere, apart of almost everything we do, and every decision we make. They are part of most if not all tech stacks used today.&#xA;Each chapter in this book will present an algorithm, an application area for some algorithm, or some other related topic.&#xA;For teaching purposes The less complex the audience, the less complex chapters you need.</description>

      <description>Characterizing Running Times As we saw in Chapter 2, order of growth gives us the ability to quantify the effectiveness of our algorithms, and compare them.&#xA;Us studying these algorithms at large enough input sizes is us studying the asymptotic efficiency of an algorithm. We can say an algorithm that is &amp;ldquo;more asymptotically efficient&amp;rdquo; is the better choice for most cases, save small inputs.&#xA;O-notation, $\Theta$-notation, and $\Omega$-notation We already met $\Theta$-notation in chapter 2; this is a type of asymptotic notation.</description>

      <description>Hosting Services and Authentication Everything we&amp;rsquo;ve done up until this point has been local. Even though some of the things we&amp;rsquo;ve looked at incentive&amp;rsquo;s working in a group, if your repository is local no one else will have access to it. This is where public repositories come into play.&#xA;There are three main players in the repository game; GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket. I personally only have experience with GitHub, so we&amp;rsquo;ll be focusing on that going forward.</description>

      <description>Merging We last looked at how branches can help a team work on a project together, without losing or any conflicting progress. Now for the logical next step- combining the work together into one branch. We call this merging, or the combining of work from different branches.&#xA;The source branch is the merging branch, or where the work is coming from. The target branch is the branch you&amp;rsquo;re merging into.</description>

      <description>Branches We last left off with our first commit in our rainbow project. Remember, we can also use git status to get an update on the status of our repository. Before we get too deep into defining what a branch is, let&amp;rsquo;s explore why they&amp;rsquo;re used. That might make it a bit easier to understand.&#xA;Why Do We Use Branches? Branches help us differentiate changes in a given project. They can be made for an number of reasons, but can be boiled down to two main points:</description>

      <description>Making a Commit We left off with our first text file in our working directory, our rainbowcolors.txt file. It has one sentence in it, and we can check that by either opening it or running cat rainbowcolors.txt in the working directory. We can see that we haven&amp;rsquo;t made any commits yet, and we only have one untracked file. You can run git status to gather all of this info.</description>

      <description>Local Repositories Introducing and Initializing a Local Repository A repository (or a repo) is the container of a project version controlled by Git. There are two; local and remote. Local is stored on your computer, while remote is obviously hosted remotely (someone else&amp;rsquo;s computer).&#xA;GitHub is one of the largest platforms and the one I&amp;rsquo;m most familiar with. GitLab and Bitbucket also exist, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t used them myself. Chapter 6 onward deals with this; for now, we can worry about it later.</description>

      <description>Git and the Command Line What is Git? Git is a version control system that keeps track of the changes done to a project or directory. When you edit a file, Git records what was added and removed. If files are added or removed, Git has it&amp;rsquo;s eyes on it (if you&amp;rsquo;re configuring it correctly).&#xA;Git was originally created by Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux. Meant to be used at the command line, it is clearly more complex then a simply saving a file.</description>

      <description>First Edition Anna Skoulikari&#xA;I got this textbook as a part of a DevOps Humble Bundle for a ridiculous price.&#xA;I have been using Git more seriously this year, so it makes sense to go through this first. It also is apart of the AI Engineer Roadmap, so even more of a reason to start.&#xA;Who the Textbook is For Anyone who wants to learn Git, and geared towards individuals who have basic technical skills, or those who need to work alongside those who use Git.</description>

      <description>Getting Sorted This chapter is meant to familiarize yourself with the framework used throughout the book.&#xA;2.1 Insertion Sort Solves a sorting problem (obviously).&#xA;The numbers to be sorted are known as keys.&#xA;The input comes in the form of an array with n elements.&#xA;A reason to sort is often because those keys are associated with other data, Satellite data.&#xA;Key + Satellite = Record&#xA;We can think of a spreadsheet, with student records having many pieces of data.</description>

      <description>Modified: August 02 2024&#xA;The Role of Algorithms in Computing 1.1 Algorithms Algorithm: Any well defined computational procedure that takes some value, or set of values, as input and produces some value, or set of values, as output in a finite amount of time.&#xA;We often say algorithms help us solve computational problems.&#xA;We can define a sorting algorithm like so:&#xA;Input: A sequence of n numbers, {a_1, a_2, ... a_n}</description>
