      <description>Recursion Recursion, or the process of a sub-program calling itself, is a reoccurring concept in many different algorithms, and a foundational topic in computer science.&#xA;It is a hard topic to understand, but not super complicated. All code examples should be ran and written yourself to gain a full understanding.&#xA;Pseudocode is another term you should familiarize yourself with, since it will be used both by this book and by myself.</description>

      <description>Selection Sort Before going into choosing an array vs. a linked list, let&amp;rsquo;s do a quick lesson on memory.&#xA;Think of your computers memory like a dresser full of small drawers. When you want to store a value, in a variable, that variable name is given an address, and whatever value is stored inside of it. Incredibly simple for single value variables- but what about multiple items? This is where picking an array or a linked list comes in.</description>

      <description>Introduction to Algorithms An algorithm is simply a set of instructions or code designed in a way to accomplish a specific task. Tasks range from solving a math problem, to how to make decision given a specific scenario.&#xA;All the algorithms featured in this text are fast, solve interesting problems, or even both. The text will introduce an algorithm, give an example, and discuss the running time in Big O (we&amp;rsquo;ll get back to this in a second).</description>

      <description>Second Edition By Aditya Y. Bhargava Not only is this book incredibly easy to follow, but it requires very little in terms of prerequisites. The most you need to know is a basic understanding of Python and Algebra.&#xA;This book is for people who already know how to code, hobbyists, visual learners, or anyone who wants to learn algorithms without a rigorous mathematical foundation.&#xA;Code for all chapters can be found here.</description>

      <description>Names, Bindings, &amp;amp; Scope We should understand that in across programming languages, like when we use the term identifier or name (both are synonymous), it depends on the language we are using. Different languages have different naming conventions and rules or syntax. We&amp;rsquo;ll look at variables in this chapter, and the different parts their made out of;&#xA;Name Address Value Type Lifetime Scope Bindings A binding is an association between an attribute and an entity, such as between a variable and it&amp;rsquo;s type or value, or between an operation and a symbol.</description>

      <description>For 2025, I want to read and document my notes on Obsidian for 20 different textbooks. I acquired most of these throughout 2024 (thank you Humble Bundle!), and I thought why not put my money where my mouth is and actually use all the books I&amp;rsquo;ve purchased. Below is a list that I&amp;rsquo;ll keep updated, as well as a link to their inevitable notes.&#xA;1. Learning Git 2. Deep Learning - Math 3.</description>

      <description>Probability and Information Theory When we encounter situations where the output is unknown, probability theory gives us a mathematical framework to deal with these statements. They use the term &amp;ldquo;quantifying uncertainty&amp;rdquo; which I like a lot. The connection between AI applications and probability come from two places; algorithms often use probability theory to give AI it&amp;rsquo;s reasoning abilities, and probability with statistics are used to grade and categorize the behavior of the AI models/agents.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re on our final chapter, and almost through with the rainbow project. Before we move onto our last lesson, let&amp;rsquo;s review where we&amp;rsquo;re at;&#xA;An important distinction we need to make up front first is that in the past, we have introduced and used pull. While that is involved in what we&amp;rsquo;re about to learn, we&amp;rsquo;re going to go more specifically into pull requests, or a request to collaborate on work via a hosting service.</description>

      <description>Rebasing We&amp;rsquo;re over ten chapters into this text; let&amp;rsquo;s get a quick recap of the status of our repos:&#xA;One thing to notice about the repos up until this point is that up to the green commit, our project&amp;rsquo;s history was linear. Some people prefer to keep their history this way, and want to avoid branching pathways, like we had to do for the three-way merges we had to make.</description>

      <description>Merge Conflicts In our last chapter, we were able to pull off our first three way merge without any issues. This time, we&amp;rsquo;re about to experience some merge conflicts, and what to do when we encounter them. You can view the end of Chapter 9 to see the visualization of where we&amp;rsquo;re at; we&amp;rsquo;ve got the M1 commit as the latest in all three repos.&#xA;One important distinction we need to make about this experiment we&amp;rsquo;re going to do versus the last chapter is the type of changes we&amp;rsquo;re going to make.</description>

      <description>Three Way Merges Every merge we&amp;rsquo;ve done so far has been a fast-forward merge. In this chapter, we&amp;rsquo;re going to take a look at performing our first three way merge, and also get some hands on experience with how editing our files out of order will affect our work flow. First, let&amp;rsquo;s simplify our visualization and update it to reflect where we left off in the last chapter;&#xA;Again, three way merges are important and necessary to understand.</description>

      <description>Cloning and Fetching As it stands, we have just pushed our local repo onto our remote repo, and updated it with all currently created branches. For this chapter, we&amp;rsquo;re going to start working through what it would be like if you&amp;rsquo;d like to start working on your project with a friend or coworker through an essential core concept of Git called cloning, or copying a remote repository.&#xA;Cloning a Remote Repository Like we know for the beginning of this text, Git is a major player in collaborative coding.</description>

      <description>Linear Algebra This book covers all topics of linear algebra that are important to deep learning, not necessarily all topics within Linear Algebra. For a text more focused in linear algebra, see here.&#xA;Scalars, Vectors, Matrices, and Tensors Scalars Single numbers, usually denoted by a lowercase variable name, and introduced with some information on the number.&#xA;Ex.&#xA;Let $s \in R$ be the slope of the line for a real-valued scalar Let $n \in N$ be the number of units for a natural number scalar Vectors An ordered array of numbers, obtainable via the index position of the number in the array.</description>

      <description>Creating and Pushing to a Remote Repository Currently, we have three commits, red, orange, and yellow. We have two branches, both of them (head and feature) pointing at our yellow commit, and HEAD is attached to main.&#xA;Now that we&amp;rsquo;re beginning to talk about remote repositories, it&amp;rsquo;s important to understand how these projects are started. We&amp;rsquo;ve been working on our Rainbow project, which we know is a local repository.</description>

      <description>Summations As we know, we analyze algorithms by their running time. When algorithms use for or while loops (iterative structures), the running time is expressed as the sum of all the times spent on execution.&#xA;Summation Formulas and Properties Say we have $a_1,a_2,&amp;hellip;a_n$ numbers, what we call a sequence. While $n$ is a non-negative integer, we can say the sum of that set is $\sum_{k=1}^{n}a_k$.&#xA;If $n=0$, value is 0.</description>

      <description>Created: July 17 2024 Modified: August 02 2024&#xA;Fourth Edition Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, Clifford Stein Preface Algorithms are everywhere, apart of almost everything we do, and every decision we make. They are part of most if not all tech stacks used today.&#xA;Each chapter in this book will present an algorithm, an application area for some algorithm, or some other related topic.&#xA;For teaching purposes The less complex the audience, the less complex chapters you need.</description>

      <description>Characterizing Running Times As we saw in Chapter 2, order of growth gives us the ability to quantify the effectiveness of our algorithms, and compare them.&#xA;Us studying these algorithms at large enough input sizes is us studying the asymptotic efficiency of an algorithm. We can say an algorithm that is &amp;ldquo;more asymptotically efficient&amp;rdquo; is the better choice for most cases, save small inputs.&#xA;O-notation, $\Theta$-notation, and $\Omega$-notation We already met $\Theta$-notation in chapter 2; this is a type of asymptotic notation.</description>

      <description>Hosting Services and Authentication Everything we&amp;rsquo;ve done up until this point has been local. Even though some of the things we&amp;rsquo;ve looked at incentive&amp;rsquo;s working in a group, if your repository is local no one else will have access to it. This is where public repositories come into play.&#xA;There are three main players in the repository game; GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket. I personally only have experience with GitHub, so we&amp;rsquo;ll be focusing on that going forward.</description>

      <description>Merging We last looked at how branches can help a team work on a project together, without losing or any conflicting progress. Now for the logical next step- combining the work together into one branch. We call this merging, or the combining of work from different branches.&#xA;The source branch is the merging branch, or where the work is coming from. The target branch is the branch you&amp;rsquo;re merging into.</description>

      <description>Branches We last left off with our first commit in our rainbow project. Remember, we can also use git status to get an update on the status of our repository. Before we get too deep into defining what a branch is, let&amp;rsquo;s explore why they&amp;rsquo;re used. That might make it a bit easier to understand.&#xA;Why Do We Use Branches? Branches help us differentiate changes in a given project. They can be made for an number of reasons, but can be boiled down to two main points:</description>

      <description>Making a Commit We left off with our first text file in our working directory, our rainbowcolors.txt file. It has one sentence in it, and we can check that by either opening it or running cat rainbowcolors.txt in the working directory. We can see that we haven&amp;rsquo;t made any commits yet, and we only have one untracked file. You can run git status to gather all of this info.</description>

      <description>Local Repositories Introducing and Initializing a Local Repository A repository (or a repo) is the container of a project version controlled by Git. There are two; local and remote. Local is stored on your computer, while remote is obviously hosted remotely (someone else&amp;rsquo;s computer).&#xA;GitHub is one of the largest platforms and the one I&amp;rsquo;m most familiar with. GitLab and Bitbucket also exist, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t used them myself. Chapter 6 onward deals with this; for now, we can worry about it later.</description>

      <description>Git and the Command Line What is Git? Git is a version control system that keeps track of the changes done to a project or directory. When you edit a file, Git records what was added and removed. If files are added or removed, Git has it&amp;rsquo;s eyes on it (if you&amp;rsquo;re configuring it correctly).&#xA;Git was originally created by Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux. Meant to be used at the command line, it is clearly more complex then a simply saving a file.</description>
