      <description>&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What makes you unique from your contemporaries? How does the culmination of all of your past experiences affect your present choices, and what does that mean about the choices you end up making? Are you destined to fall back into the cycle of what has been, or can you throw everything away and start over, and be able to tell the tale of it all?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These are the questions I gathered Mr. Rushdie is trying to ask with the Satanic Verses, among other things (should everything that&amp;rsquo;s said from those you trust be taken face value without question?). What sets a Salman Rushdie book apart from the rest, other than me having to heavily reference a dictionary, is it&amp;rsquo;s beautiful presentation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
