      <description>Goal Get current bookings page working Look into filtering requests/bookings Don&amp;rsquo;t want to have to refresh the page, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to constantly update as the user is typing. Results should only appear upon hitting enter. Accomplishments Current bookings was a lot easier now that I&amp;rsquo;m using a template for all my pages, and it was a breeze to create a new blueprint for the page since it&amp;rsquo;s even less code than the requests page, due to their not needing to handle any post requests.</description>

      <description>Goal Coming back from a few days to think about a game plan for the finish line, I think I can get something out and working by the end of these 30 days. Maybe.&#xA;Finish applying base.html to all pages Make the admin index page for current requests page for current bookings page for manual application form Finish CSS for pages Accomplishments Got a ton done today, and worked for probably over 2 hours.</description>

      <description>Goal Start working on HTML/CSS changes Finish reformatting HTML with base.html Accomplishments Surprisingly, got a decent amount done in just under an hour. I was able to complete the base.html file, and worked out some of the kinks of the formatting. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t look exactly like the Figma yet, but I want to make sure all of the HTML files have the base.html extension first.&#xA;Problems or Issues Next: Day 23</description>

      <description>Goal Get Calendly to prefill info for booking link Accomplishments I really thought todays goal was going to be harder, but it actually ended up being pretty easy. All I had to do was edit the URL and pass in some parameters. I thought maybe I&amp;rsquo;d have to set up a developer account and use JSON/JavaScript, but honestly it seems fine without it?&#xA;Problems or Issues Next: Day 22</description>

      <description>Goal Correctly sync the booking form to choose which type of session Caret drop down menu &amp;amp; link to appropriate function Small Tattoo Session Medium Tattoo Session Large Tattoo Session Small Tattoo Reschedule Medium Tattoo Reschedule Tattoo Touchup Accomplishments Got a ton done today; walked through the Figma with Big Boss and was able to get going on the layout. Promising results on that front shortly.&#xA;I was able to get the quick note I made down below finished pretty quick, and glad I did since that will help out immensely when I start building out the search/filter feature.</description>

      <description>Goal Finish the Figma for site Mess around on Calendly Accomplishments Finished the preliminary wireframe for the site, handed off to big boss So another rejection as far as my current layout for the site. I was able to get started and get an actual calendar embedded into the site which worked nicely. I now have a new slew of issues to worry about;&#xA;There are 3 types of bookings to account for Normal tattoo sessions, three types Small (&amp;gt;2hrs) Medium (2 - 5hrs) Large (5+hrs) Reschedules Small (2hrs) Medium (3hrs30) Touchups (1hr30) Change Admin&amp;rsquo;s booking page to choose which type of session Booking should generate and save a link to it in the SQLite database for use later Artist can send via dm with info already filled out Figure out how to give Calendly forms pre-saved information Problems or Issues Next: Day 20</description>

      <description>Goal Goals for today are quite simple; complete the look of the website on Figma, so the boss can come in and make design changes before I start committing any time towards building in HTML/CSS. I&amp;rsquo;m building out a basic skeleton for her to build off of, and I should be able to finish that today.&#xA;As far as the project is coming along, since we are moving away from using Full Calendar, I think we&amp;rsquo;re going to just integrate with Calendly.</description>

      <description>Goal First day back!&#xA;I was sick for maybe 2, 3 weeks? Probably the worst cold I&amp;rsquo;ve had in my life, and of course it happened in the midst of my 30 day challenge. I almost tried to work through it, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t focus at all and had to stop completely. Instead of calling it quits though, I&amp;rsquo;m going to start Day 17 over as a new day, and try and get back up on the saddle.</description>

      <description>Goal Honestly, I might be taking a small break today? I mostly wanted to get the ball rolling this week but after yesterday, I think I might have to settle for Calendly integration before trying to re-create their services. The Twilio account rejected my verification again, and after trying to build a working calendar system through JavaScript, I realized two things; I suck at JavaScript and don&amp;rsquo;t know what I&amp;rsquo;m doing, and Twilio has everything I&amp;rsquo;m looking for plus a little more.</description>

      <description>Goal From Yesterday:&#xA;Set up text message for request Client Artist Integrate with Google Calendar For Today:&#xA;Change calendar to full month and change the formatting Had a talk with the boss, and she wants it to look a little bit different than the week-hour grid I had going on. Instead, I need each date to be clickable when available, and when clicked, needs to open up a little window in front with the available times.</description>

(maybe way down the line) Make a confirm booking button that checks to make sure there is no issue with timing Accomplishments Getting a lot done today; more so with understanding how the calendar features work for Fullcalendar.</description>

      <description>Goal From Yesterday:&#xA;Accomplishments I looked more into Twilio and it seems like they have their own API that can be used to make sure it&amp;rsquo;s compliant with their rules. I&amp;rsquo;m going to try editing in a checkbox option that allows the user to check yes before submitting the application. If they don&amp;rsquo;t say yes, the database save will not include the phone number, save it as None, and text message reminders won&amp;rsquo;t be sent to them.</description>

      <description>Goal From Yesterday:&#xA;Set up text message for request Client Artist For Today:&#xA;Booking Python file Figure out how Google Calendar works Accomplishments Had a good talk with the boss about the structuring of the site so far. I had misunderstood the need for a &amp;ldquo;fast form&amp;rdquo;, it really should just be a button that sends a booking form that she fills out the request details and customer information for.</description>

      <description>After running my laptop on Ubuntu for the past 4 months (and enjoying it) I figured it was time to give some other distros a chance. One of the YouTube channels I watch in order to expand my horizons is Mischa van den Burg who specializes in cloud computing dev ops things. I&amp;rsquo;ve watched a ton of his videos and got inspired to learn more about dev ops mostly through his influence.</description>

One thing that I&amp;rsquo;m trying to to stress is the prettification of all of my elements. I got the emails working, but they look like crap.</description>

      <description>Goal From Yesterday:&#xA;Format the Email back to client Accomplishments I didn&amp;rsquo;t get to work on this project much this weekend, and honestly I feel kind of okay about it? I am going to be putting off the AI roadmap on hold until this month is over to see if that helps with my workflow. This week I tried to do both and it left me really wanting to pick one over the other, so perhaps I&amp;rsquo;ll just leave the AI roadmap stuff on the back burner while I work hard on the next few days.</description>

Otherwise, not a whole lot got done today.&#xA;Problems or Issues When running the Gmail quickstart code, I neglected to realize you would need to change the SCOPE list variable to allow more authorizations.</description>

      <description>Modified: August 02 2024&#xA;Watched this video to take some notes on what REST is.&#xA;API: Application Programming Interface, is how to computers can communicate with each other.&#xA;Client sends a Request to the server, server sends a response back to the client.&#xA;REST, or Representational State Transfer, is the most popular way to communicate with these web servers.&#xA;REST is actually a set of rules and standards. Any API that follows the REST rules is known as a RESTful API.</description>

      <description>A passion project I&amp;rsquo;d like to make. It would be my first time using hardware and software together.&#xA;To start, I&amp;rsquo;d like to grab a raspberry pi with a screen and audio in so it can display the record cover, the title, artist, and duration that updates as the song goes on.&#xA;I first asked ChatGPT 3.5 for advice.&#xA;I also asked ChatGPT 4o and got a little better/pointed advice.</description>
