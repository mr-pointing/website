      <description>Modified: August 02 2024&#xA;Watched this video to take some notes on what REST is.&#xA;API: Application Programming Interface, is how to computers can communicate with each other.&#xA;Client sends a Request to the server, server sends a response back to the client.&#xA;REST, or Representational State Transfer, is the most popular way to communicate with these web servers.&#xA;REST is actually a set of rules and standards. Any API that follows the REST rules is known as a RESTful API.</description>

      <description>Modified: June 22 2024&#xA;A passion project I&amp;rsquo;d like to make. It would be my first time using hardware and software together.&#xA;To start, I&amp;rsquo;d like to grab a raspberry pi with a screen and audio in so it can display the record cover, the title, artist, and duration that updates as the song goes on.&#xA;I first asked ChatGPT 3.5 for advice.&#xA;I also asked ChatGPT 4o and got a little better/pointed advice.</description>
