      <description>After running my laptop on Ubuntu for the past 4 months (and enjoying it) I figured it was time to give some other distros a chance. One of the YouTube channels I watch in order to expand my horizons is Mischa van den Burg who specializes in cloud computing dev ops things. I&amp;rsquo;ve watched a ton of his videos and got inspired to learn more about dev ops mostly through his influence.</description>

      <description>Goal From Yesterday:&#xA;Format the Email back to client Accomplishments I didn&amp;rsquo;t get to work on this project much this weekend, and honestly I feel kind of okay about it? I am going to be putting off the AI roadmap on hold until this month is over to see if that helps with my workflow. This week I tried to do both and it left me really wanting to pick one over the other, so perhaps I&amp;rsquo;ll just leave the AI roadmap stuff on the back burner while I work hard on the next few days.</description>

      <description>Goal From yesterday:&#xA;Test email sending/receiving Format the Email back to client Accomplishments Today was a very busy work day, so I really didn&amp;rsquo;t get that far on anything.

Otherwise, not a whole lot got done today.&#xA;Problems or Issues When running the Gmail quickstart code, I neglected to realize you would need to change the SCOPE list variable to allow more authorizations.</description>

      <description>Modified: August 02 2024&#xA;Watched this video to take some notes on what REST is.&#xA;API: Application Programming Interface, is how to computers can communicate with each other.&#xA;Client sends a Request to the server, server sends a response back to the client.&#xA;REST, or Representational State Transfer, is the most popular way to communicate with these web servers.&#xA;REST is actually a set of rules and standards. Any API that follows the REST rules is known as a RESTful API.</description>

      <description>A passion project I&amp;rsquo;d like to make. It would be my first time using hardware and software together.&#xA;To start, I&amp;rsquo;d like to grab a raspberry pi with a screen and audio in so it can display the record cover, the title, artist, and duration that updates as the song goes on.&#xA;I first asked ChatGPT 3.5 for advice.&#xA;I also asked ChatGPT 4o and got a little better/pointed advice.</description>
