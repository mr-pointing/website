      <description>One that&amp;rsquo;s been on my reading list since I was a kid and saw the dynamic spiral cover, Ring is the original book that inspired the prolific and perfectly-spoofed movie of the same name. Hearing this was a series made me nervous this wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be great, but I ended up enjoying it at some parts.&#xA;It went by really fast. The main character was the worst dude. Hated how much he clearly did not care about his wife and kids until he put them in danger.</description>
