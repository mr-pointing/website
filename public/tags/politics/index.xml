      <description>&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Not much to say about this one that hasn&amp;rsquo;t already been said; regardless, a great insight into the past and what it means to unite with your fellow human peers. The forward clues you into the perspective of the world&amp;rsquo;s reaction to it. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to believe, since now banding together against a stronger and more materially wealthy minority is such a common theme that persists through countless forms of media.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After deep reflection, I still lack the ability to properly give my feedback while remaining professional. This was an incredibly difficult read. Not only was it incredibly lengthy and full of citations and footnotes, it was dense with historical information and new vocabulary. I found myself looking up definitions, synopsis&amp;rsquo; of political parties and events, and having to watch numerous supplemental material to actually follow along. Was this a good thing? I like to think so; it drove me to research a lot on my own, and after 50 or so pages the prose and vocabulary became more tolerable. If only it didn&amp;rsquo;t take another 600 pages/3 months to finish it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
