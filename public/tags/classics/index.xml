      <description>&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What is the reason we write? I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if that&amp;rsquo;s the right way to start this review, but it was something that bothered me the entire time reading Moby Dick. What was the reason for all of this lexical analysis? Was there any benefit to my experience knowing the nitty gritty details of how whales are killed, dissected, and harvested for materials?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At first I thought it was meaningless; fluff to drive out the length of the novel. Fortunately, after finishing it and doing some more research, Herman&amp;rsquo;s expansive diatribes are somewhat useful. At the time of publishing (1851) the knowledge of whales and their general species was largely misinformed. You don&amp;rsquo;t have to go research to find that out, Ishmael literally tells you in great detail all of the faults of his modern-day understanding of the great leviathans. Part adventure story of course, but also part learning experience. I started to enjoy the longer chapters a little more when put into that perspective.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
