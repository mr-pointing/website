I finished Words of Radiance two days ago, and it initially got a 4 out of 5. I loved the book. I really did, and was invested from start to finish.
It took me about 3 weeks (3 weeks and 3 days says Goodreads) and it really flew by. I enjoyed tackling such a huge tome of a novel.
The characters were awesome, even if I felt like the interlude characters could have been longer to make them a bit more memorable.</description></item></channel></rss>
