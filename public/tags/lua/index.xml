      <description>The Eight Queens Problem Not a whole lot going on in this chapter, but they present a fun example of Lua&amp;rsquo;s capabilities. Walking through this code is worthwhile; I recommend giving it a read first, trying it out yourself, and changing some things around to get some different outcomes.&#xA;N = 8 -- board size -- check whether position (n,c) is free from attacks function isplaceok (a, n, c) for i = 1, n - 1 do&#x9;-- for each queen already placed.</description>

      <description>Fourth Edition By Roberto Ierusalimschy Lua was initially designed to be integrated with software written in C/C++. It&amp;rsquo;s a small yet powerful language, and achieves this by not trying to do what C already does; perform well. Lua offers dynamic structures, zero redundancies, and a simpler time testing and debugging code.&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s an extensible language; things like dynamic typing, automatic memory management, and first-class functions make Lua a good pick for small to even medium/large projects.</description>

      <description>Getting Started Just like any other language, standard output is a great first step. To do so on a windows machine, you have to download Lua much like you do Python, and run it via the command line. The fastest way I did this was through a command line installer scoop, and installed it with scoop install lua. Then just use lua to run your environment.&#xA;A simple print() will put anything on the screen:</description>
