      <description>Core Plugins Out of the box, Obsidian has a plethora of usable features. Most you might never touch. Others will be ingrained in your workflow you&amp;rsquo;ll forget they&amp;rsquo;re plugins. This list is not extensive- like everything else, more detailed information can be found in their documentation.&#xA;Outgoing and Backlinks We already saw how powerful linking can be using Obsidian. Let&amp;rsquo;s define two specific types of links; outgoing links and backlinks.</description>

      <description>Editing and Formatting Congratulations, after this year you&amp;rsquo;ll technically know two languages! Markdown, what we&amp;rsquo;re writing in, isn&amp;rsquo;t technically a programming language, but it is a useful format to understand and be able to read, just in case something isn&amp;rsquo;t rendered or just browsing files.&#xA;Basic Formatting Syntax A paragraph is just a block of text, separated by a newline. The paragraph for a literal example:&#xA;This is a paragraph.</description>

      <description>User Interface A user interface, otherwise referred to as a UI, is the visual parts of a program you interact with when using it. For Obsidian, the UI is the entire window. Let&amp;rsquo;s break it down piece by piece.&#xA;Appearance Before we go any further, we should go over the fun part. Making it your own. If your left bar isn&amp;rsquo;t already open, hit the button on the top left (it&amp;rsquo;s a little square with lines in it).</description>

      <title>Obsidian Help - Preface</title>

      <description>Link to Documentation.&#xA;What is Obsidian? Essentially, a note-taking tool. All it boils down too is the format in which your notes are placed (I just think Obsidian is neat). Obsidian uses a Markdown, a markup-language. Not really a programming language, more of an encoding language, but we don&amp;rsquo;t need to worry about that for right now.&#xA;For now, all we are going to focus on is the basics-you have something you want to take notes on, and you write down your notes inside.</description>

      <title>Explaining my Obsidian to Hugo Workflow</title>

      <description>Where We Left Off I was just able to get my website viewable for the first time in Hugo&amp;rsquo;s draft view. I worked through the formatting errors that my Hugo theme wasn&amp;rsquo;t compatible with, and everything is looking good.&#xA;Implementing Git was also incredibly simple. If you don&amp;rsquo;t know anything about Git, you can start by reading my analysis of a beginner Git textbook. Since Hugo requires you using a separate directory for content, just initialize a new repo in your directory, connect it to a GitHub repo, and you&amp;rsquo;re off to the races.</description>

      <description>As a first official post, why not start at the beginning. I want to quickly go over how I started, my motivations, and the first issues I ran into. The footnotes will reference all of the articles and videos I watched that helped contribute to how it works today.&#xA;Components Obsidian Git/GitHub Hugo Cloudflare How I Started Regarding Obsdian, I began writing as if I were dictating to my students.</description>

      <title>Current Obsidian Plugins</title>
      <link>https://mrpointing.com/notes/obsidian/current-obsidian-plugins/</link>

      <description>Community Plugins Community plugins keep some pieces of software alive. When development stops on a product, often the users can keep producing forks of the initial project and continue developing their own functions and uses for the app. In Obsidian&amp;rsquo;s case, even while production is still going, they implore users to develop their own plugins to meet their own needs.&#xA;One thing should be stressed; community plugins should only be prioritized after learning the ins and outs of core Obsidian.</description>
