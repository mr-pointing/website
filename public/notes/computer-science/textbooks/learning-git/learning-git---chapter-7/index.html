<h1 id="creating-and-pushing-to-a-remote-repository">Creating and Pushing to a Remote Repository</h1>
<p>Currently, we have three commits, <code>red</code>, <code>orange</code>, and <code>yellow</code>. We have two branches, both of them (<code>head</code> and <code>feature</code>) pointing at our <code>yellow</code> commit, and <code>HEAD</code> is attached to <code>main</code>.</p>
<p>Now that we&rsquo;re beginning to talk about remote repositories, it&rsquo;s important to understand how these projects are started. We&rsquo;ve been working on our Rainbow project, which we know is a <em>local</em> repository.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s our first way; to start from a local repository. We already looked at how to start a local repository, so there are only two more steps: Create a remote repository using your service of choice, then <em>push</em> your local repository to your remote repository. We can use the <code>git push</code> command to make this happen.</p>
<p>The other way is to start from a remote repository. If you want to work on someone else&rsquo;s project, or you created an empty remote repository, you would need to <em>clone</em> the repository to your local machine to start working.</p>
<p>Even if we have our local repository pushed into a remote repository, and changes made to either won&rsquo;t reflect in the other unless explicitly told to do so. That means when you make a commit in your local repository, it won&rsquo;t have any changes to the remote repository until you push them.</p>
<p>Remote repositories utility cannot be understated; having access to all of your projects wherever you go, as well as being able to have collaborators and contribute to other people&rsquo;s projects, really makes this a worthwhile feature.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Example Book Project]
Once again we&rsquo;re back to working on our book project. If I never decided to upload my work into remote repository, and my laptop got stolen or damaged, all of my work is lost. It would also be nice to have two workstations, and I can easily transfer my work from machine to machine without losing anything in the process.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To create our Rainbow project remote repository, we&rsquo;re going to have to create it, connect it, and push our directory into it.</p>
<h2 id="creating-the-remote-repository">Creating the Remote Repository</h2>
<p>The creation and configuration is a split process between the local repository and the website of your hosting provider. GitHub will need a remote repository name, and will provide you with a URL (provided in both SSH and HTTPS).</p>
<p>To ensure as little confusion as possible, we&rsquo;re going to name our remote repository differently than our local. We&rsquo;ll call it <code>remote-repository</code>. You&rsquo;ll also be option to give the remote repository the option to be public or private. Private means that only you have access to it, while Public will leave it open for anyone on the internet to get access to it.</p>
<p>Some remote repository providers will ask for additional files (Either a <code>README</code> or a <code>.gitignore</code>) but we&rsquo;ll ignore that for now, since we want to upload our entire local directory as is. The default branch name should also be <code>main</code>.</p>

    <img src="/images/remote_directory.png"  alt="remote_directory"  class="center"  style="border-radius: 8px;"  />


<p>You should now have an empty remote repository. We still have to link them, which is what the <code>git remote</code> command is for. The syntax to make this connection is as follows;</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>git remote add &lt;shortname&gt; &lt;URL&gt;
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Remember, we are going to use HTTPS for this, so <code>URL</code> is going to be the URL provided by GitHub, while the <code>shortname</code> will be whatever you call that connection for future use. Like we know from the first few chapters in the history of Git, we should probably use <code>origin</code> for our <code>shortname</code>, since that&rsquo;s the default value used anyways.</p>
<p>You could also use <code>git remote</code> by itself to return all of the remote repository connections used in your local repository, and <code>git remote -v</code> to grab their <code>shortname</code>&rsquo;s <em>and</em> <code>URL</code>&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>For me, my command flow looked like this;</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; git remote <span style="color:#75715e"># noticing I don&#39;t have anything returned</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; git remote add origin https://github.com/mr-pointing/rainbow-remote.git
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; git remote
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>origin      <span style="color:#75715e"># now I have the shortname (origin) appearing</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>If we were to add onto our diagram from just before, there would now be a line going from our local repository, pointing to our new remote repository. However, it would still be empty, and it&rsquo;s important to note this is only a one way relationship; the local repository is not receiving anything from the remote.</p>
<h2 id="remote-branches-and-remote-tracking-branches">Remote Branches and Remote-Tracking Branches</h2>
<p>A <em>remote branch</em> is just a branch in a remote repository, pretty simple. However it seems that they work a little differently than our local branches. They don&rsquo;t update alongside our local commits; they will only be updated with a <em>push</em>.</p>
<p>Another branch that seems important is the <em>remote-tracking branch</em>, which acts like a placeholder for the remote repository. It&rsquo;s a reference inside your local repo for your remote repo (I&rsquo;m going to start abbreviating repository to repo mid sentence, it&rsquo;s just faster and easier at this point) that has a pointer to the commit that the remote repository had at the last connection, sometimes referred as the <em>upstream branch</em>. This is sometimes chosen by Git, but otherwise can be chosen (we&rsquo;ll come back to this in Chapter 9).</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s actually make that push we were just talking about. We can use the following syntax to make a push onto a remote repo;</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>git push &lt;shortname&gt; &lt;branch_name&gt;
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>When doing this, you&rsquo;ll actually create both a remote branch and a remote-tracking branch. We&rsquo;ll also be able to use <code>git branch --all</code> to see the new branch changes.</p>
<p>Also, before we do this, make sure to point <code>HEAD</code> at <code>main</code>, and your on your <code>yellow</code> commit. Also, this took me <em><strong>forever</strong></em> to understand, but I think because I was using Linux I needed to generate a <em>Personal Access Token</em> in your developer settings, and it wouldn&rsquo;t accept my password as authentication.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; git push origin main
