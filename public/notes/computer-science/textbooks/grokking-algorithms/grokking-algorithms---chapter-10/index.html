<h1 id="greedy-algorithms">Greedy Algorithms</h1>
<p>A simpler concept than the last few we just tackled, <em>Greedy Algorithms</em> are algorithms that pick the most optimal movement at each step. This seems vague, and it is! You are literally just picking the most <em>locally optimal solution</em>, or the best choice, until you&rsquo;re left with the <em>globally optimal solution</em>.</p>
<p>If you have a day where you&rsquo;re trying to schedule classes &amp; have as many as you possibly can, taking up your entire schedule. How would you plan your day? The major issue is that the classes times overlap; some start while others are still going, etc.</p>
<p>There are many ways we can try to solve this, but simplicity is sometimes all we need:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pick the class that ends the soonest. This becomes your first class</li>
<li>Next, pick a class that starts after the first. This becomes your second class</li>
<li>Repeat until schedule is filled</li>
</ol>
<p>In this situation, greedy algorithms helped out and made solving our problem extremely simple.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s another scenario: We have a knapsack with a 35-pound weight limit. There are 3 items we can steal; A Nintendo Switch for $1500 weighing 15 pounds, a P.C. worth $3000 weighing 30 pounds, and Laptop for $2000 weighing 20 pounds.</p>
<p>In this situation, a greedy algorithm might actually hurt us more than help. A good greedy algorithm for this might be something like this;</p>
<ol>
<li>Pick the most expensive item that fits</li>
<li>Pick the next most expensive item</li>
<li>Repeat until knapsack is full</li>
</ol>
<p>This, unfortunately, would not give us desired results. If I went for the most expensive thing, I would have grabbed the P.C., and immediately filled up my bag. I have 5 pounds of wasted space. The better combination would have been to take the Switch and the Laptop, resulting in $5000 more.</p>
<h3 id="exercises">Exercises</h3>
<ol>
<li>You work for a furniture moving company. Come up with a greedy algorithm to store the moving truck to maximize space. Will it give an optimal solution?</li>
</ol>
<p>Store the largest box first, then store the next largest box, and repeat until the moving truck is full. This has the potential to be un-optimal, due to factors such as balance, # of items, size of items, etc.)</p>
<ol>
<li>Say you&rsquo;re traveling, and keep track of all the places you want to go with a number associated to show how much you want to go. Would a greedy algorithm work?</li>
</ol>
<p>Yes it would work! Go to the attraction with the highest number, then the next highest, and so on. Even if you don&rsquo;t get to do some things, you got the most important ones done first.</p>
<h2 id="the-set-covering-problem">The Set Covering Problem</h2>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got an incredibly difficult task ahead of us; we want to start a radio show and want to reach all 50 states. We would have to map out all of the stations, since some overlap into similar areas.</p>
<p>To figure out the smallest set of stations to reach everyone, you actually have to list <em>all</em> possible subsets of stations (called a <strong>powerset</strong>). The time to run this is ($2^n$), which takes an extremely long time once you get past 10 stations.</p>
<p>Greedy algorithms can help us out here and help us get a good solution. More formally greedy algorithms are considered <em>approximation algorithm</em>, since the answer they return isn&rsquo;t always the most optimal solution, it&rsquo;s a good enough solution. The exact solution takes up too much time to figure out, so we can settle for good enough:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pick the station that covers the most states not covered</li>
<li>Repeat until all states are covered</li>
</ol>
<p>This will get us a fast, reasonably good answer that&rsquo;s close to the optimal choice, and runs in $O(n^2)$! Much faster than before, and $n$ is the number of stations.</p>

<p>Instead of working with all 50 states, let&rsquo;s just grab as subset of them, specifically the West Coast. The above diagram shows different stations, represented by different colors. The station numbers are noted in the key.</p>
