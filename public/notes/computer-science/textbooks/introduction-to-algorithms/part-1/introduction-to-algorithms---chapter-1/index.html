<h2 id="the-role-of-algorithms-in-computing">The Role of Algorithms in Computing</h2>
<h2 id="11-algorithms">1.1 Algorithms</h2>
<p><strong>Algorithm:</strong> Any well defined computational procedure that takes some value, or set of values, as <em>input</em> and produces some value, or set of values, as <em>output</em> in a finite amount of time.</p>
<p>We often say algorithms help us solve computational problems.</p>
<p>We can define a sorting algorithm like so:</p>
<p><strong>Input:</strong> A sequence of <em>n</em> numbers, <code>{a_1, a_2, ... a_n}</code></p>
<p><strong>Output:</strong> A permutation (reordering) <code>{a_1,a_2,...a_n}</code> of the input sequence such that <code>a_1 &lt;= a_2 &lt;= ... &lt;= an</code></p>
<p>If given (7, 3, 12, 1, 5), the correct sorting algorithm, would return (1, 3, 5, 7, 12).</p>
<p>The input sequence is called an <em>instance</em> of the sorting problem.</p>
<p>The <em>instance of a problem</em> is an input sequence needed to compute a solution to said problem.</p>
<p>Sorting is a fundamental concept in programming, considering how many times one is used as an intermediate step.</p>
<p>To that affect, different sorting algorithms are good at accomplishing different things.</p>
<p>We consider an algorithm for a computational problem as correct, if for every instance, it halts - or stops in a finite time and outputs the correct solution to the problem instance.</p>
<p>What kinds of problems are solved by algorithms?</p>
<ul>
<li>The Human Genome Project, identifying the unique 30,000 Human DNA genes, uses complex Algorithms, Dynamic Programming among them.</li>
<li>The internet, using algorithms to determine the best route to send data, and search engines find pages on most relevant information.</li>
<li>Electronic Commerce allows for exchange of goods and services; public-key cryptography and digital signature are based on numerical algorithms &amp; number theory.</li>
</ul>
<p>We can look at specific problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shortest route to destination (Chapter 22)</li>
<li>Doctors using clustering algorithms for tumors (Chapter 33)</li>
<li>Compression (Chapter 15)</li>
</ul>
<p>Problems that can be solved with Algorithms have two common characteristics:</p>
<ol>
<li>They have lots of candidate solutions, most which don&rsquo;t solve the problem, and finding the best is hard.</li>
<li>They have practical applications</li>
</ol>
<p>7/23/24</p>
<p>Some problems are so complex, no algorithm can solve them in an appropriate amount of time. We call these types of problems <em>NP-Complete problems</em> (see Chapter 34).</p>
<ol>
<li>No one knows if efficient algorithms exist for NP-complete problems</li>
<li>If a solution exists for one, a solution exists for all of them</li>
<li>No NP-complete problem is the same, but they are similar.</li>
</ol>
<p>NP-complete problems appear often in everyday solutions.</p>
<p>We might have access to computers with multiple cores, which allows for <em>&ldquo;Task-Parallelism&rdquo;</em> (see Chapter 26).</p>
<p>Algorithms that receive input over time, rather than having input present at the start, are called <em>online algorithms</em> (see Chapter 27).</p>
<h3 id="exercises-11">Exercises 1.1</h3>
<ol>
<li>Describe your own real-world example that requires sorting. Describe one that requires finding the shortest distance between two points.</li>
</ol>
<p>A quick example: organizing socks (low-cut vs. high-cut).
Distance: when j-walking</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Other than speed, what other measures of efficiency might you need to consider in a real-world setting?</li>
</ol>
<p>Legibility: can the algorithm produce output that is easily understandable? Is the algorithm itself readable?</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Select a data structure that you have seen, and discuss it&rsquo;s strengths and limitations.</li>
</ol>
<p>A USB Stick:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pros: Able to travel easily, holds most files</li>
<li>Cons: Not large usually (storage wise), easy to wash/lose</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4">
<li>How are the shortest-path and traveling salesperson problems given above similar? How are they different?</li>
</ol>
<p>Similarities: Both deal with distance, and need to know/search for their paths before traveling.</p>
<p>Differences: Shortest-path deals with A - B, while traveling-salesperson has to account for <em>n</em> number of stops, and compare each iteration to find the most efficient.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Suggest a real-world problem in which only the best solution will do. Then, come up with one in which &ldquo;approximately&rdquo; the best solution is good enough.</li>
</ol>
<p>I would say something as inconsequential as perfect or near-perfect, it would come down to a question of scope and overall consequences. Let&rsquo;s take for example, fixing the subway stations here in NYC. The route in which stations are fixed, or sorted, should be intentional. This would facilitate a best-case scenario decision only. However, if there is <strong>no</strong> best case, where everyone is inconvenienced regardless of the route, the near best would be acceptable.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Suggest a real-world problem in which sometimes the entire input is available before you need to solve a problem, but other times the input is not entirely available in advance and arrives over time.</li>
</ol>
<p>Shipping statistics is the first that comes to mind. We know when we place an order, where the order is going, and an approximation that is usually accurate. This isn&rsquo;t always the case however. Unexpected weather conditions always throw off shipping dates.</p>
<h2 id="12-algorithms-as-a-technology">1.2 Algorithms as a technology</h2>
<p>If computers were infinitely fast, any method that&rsquo;s correct for solving a problem would do.</p>
<p>You should choose algorithms that use the resources of time and space efficiently; both are precious.</p>
<h3 id="efficiency">Efficiency</h3>
<p>Let&rsquo;s consider two sorting methods:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Insertion Sort</strong>: takes <code>C_1n^2</code> to sort <code>n</code> items, where <code>C_1</code> is a constant, but we can just say it takes <code>n^2</code></li>
<li><strong>Merge Sort:</strong> takes <code>C_2n lg n</code>, where <code>lgn</code> stands for <code>log_2 n</code> and <code>C_2</code> is another constant</li>
</ol>
<p>Insertion sort typically has a smaller constant factor than merge sort, so that <code>C_1 &lt; C_2</code>. However, constant factors have far less of an impact on running time than the dependency of the input size.</p>
<p>We can take the two above and explain their run times as so:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Insertion:</strong> <code>C_1*n*n</code></li>
<li><strong>Merge:</strong> <code>C_2*n*lgn</code></li>
</ul>
<p>For larger numbers, <code>lgn</code> will always return smaller than <code>n</code>.</p>
<p>When <code>n=1000</code>, <code>lgn = 10</code>. When <code>n=1000000</code>, <code>lgn = 20</code>.</p>
<p>Basically, we should be using insertion sort for smaller input sizes, and merge for larger.</p>
<p>Algorithms should be understood as a technology. Even though technology has advanced to abstraction being the primary objective of most software, everything regardless uses algorithms in some way.</p>
<p>Having a solid base of algorithmic knowledge and technique is one characteristic of a good programmer.</p>
<h3 id="exercises-12">Exercises 1.2</h3>
<ol>
<li>Give an example of an application that requires algorithmic content at the application level, and discuss the function of the algorithms involved.</li>
</ol>
<p>Instagram is a really easy answer. The feed is literally called &ldquo;the algorithm&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s based off many different factors. Said algorithm dictates your engagement to a certain extent.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Suppose that for inputs of size <code>n</code> on a particular computer, insertion sort runs in <code>8n^2</code> steps and merge sort runs in <code>64nlogn</code> steps. For which values of <code>n</code> does insertion sort beat merge sort?</li>
</ol>
<p>We can start by using an example of just 10 instructions, then incrementing up by increasing the exponent by 1 We&rsquo;ll be dividing by <code>10^7</code>, our virtual computer that can perform that many tasks per minute. Our answer will be returned in seconds.</p>

    <img src="/images/Insertion_Merge_10.png"  alt="DateFormatting"  class="center"  style="border-radius: 8px;"  />


<p>Insertion sort is faster, so we keep going. Let&rsquo;s go up to the next interval, <code>10^2</code> instructions.</p>

    <img src="/images/Insertion_Merge_10_2.png"  alt="DateFormatting"  class="center"  style="border-radius: 8px;"  />


<p>So, we see that somewhere between 10 and 100 commands, merge sort begins to beat out insertion. I also tried 50, which Merge sort still beat. I ended up testing until I found out the exact one which is a bit boring so the answer is 27.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>What is the smallest value of <code>n</code> such that an algorithm whose running time is <code>100n^2</code> runs faster than an algorithm whose running time is <code>2^n</code> on the same machine?</li>
</ol>
<p>We&rsquo;ll be using the same machine time (<code>10^7</code>) and starting at 10 instructions, and incrementing up.</p>

    <img src="/images/a_and_b_problem.png"  alt="DateFormatting"  class="center"  style="border-radius: 8px;"  />


<p>B is faster, but not by so much, so let&rsquo;s only increment up a little, to lets say 15.</p>

    <img src="/images/a_and_b_problem_2.png"  alt="DateFormatting"  class="center"  style="border-radius: 8px;"  />


<p>A is faster! But is this the minimum value? Let&rsquo;s go down one to make sure.</p>

    <img src="/images/a_and_b_problem_3.png"  alt="DateFormatting"  class="center"  style="border-radius: 8px;"  />


<p>Yup, the next lowest has B winning. So the smallest value A can be is 15.</p>
