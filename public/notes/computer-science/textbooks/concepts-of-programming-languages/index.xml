      <description>Data Types What is a data type? Data types are a collection of data values and set of pre-defined operations on those values. One major benefit of data typing is error catching. Another is documentation; we can tell a lot about about a program based on it&amp;rsquo;s data types and types used.&#xA;The two most common structured (non-scalar) data types are arrays and records. Structured data types defined w/ type operators, or constructors (C uses brackets for arrays, asterisks for pointers).</description>

      <description>Names, Bindings, &amp;amp; Scope We should understand that in across programming languages, like when we use the term identifier or name (both are synonymous), it depends on the language we are using. Different languages have different naming conventions and rules or syntax. We&amp;rsquo;ll look at variables in this chapter, and the different parts their made out of;&#xA;Name Address Value Type Lifetime Scope Bindings A binding is an association between an attribute and an entity, such as between a variable and it&amp;rsquo;s type or value, or between an operation and a symbol.</description>
