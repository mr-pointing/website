<h1 id="names-bindings--scope">Names, Bindings, &amp; Scope</h1>
<p>We should understand that in across programming languages, like when we use the term <em>identifier</em> or <em>name</em> (both are synonymous), it depends on the language we are using. Different languages have different naming conventions and rules or <strong>syntax</strong>. We&rsquo;ll look at variables in this chapter, and the different parts their made out of;</p>
<ul>
<li>Name</li>
<li>Address</li>
<li>Value</li>
<li>Type</li>
<li>Lifetime</li>
<li>Scope</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="bindings">Bindings</h2>
<p>A <em>binding</em> is an association between an attribute and an entity, such as between a variable and it&rsquo;s type or value, or between an operation and a symbol. We consider the moment where the binding takes place appropriately as <em>binding time</em>. Before any variable can be reference, it must be bound to a data type (which will be covered in the next chapter).</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a very a basic sample in C++:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-c++" data-lang="c++"><span style="display:flex;"><span>count <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> count <span style="color:#f92672">+</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">5</span>;
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Let&rsquo;s review some key details going on behind the scenes:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Count&rsquo;s Type?</em> Bound at compile time</li>
<li><em>Meaning of +?</em> Bound at compile time, after operands have been determined
<ul>
<li>Quick interjection on my notes; the difference between &ldquo;compile time&rdquo; and &ldquo;compiler design time&rdquo; is compile time is the event of source code into machine code, while compiler design time is the literal design on the language</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>5&rsquo;s meaning?</em> Bound at compiler design time</li>
<li><em>Count&rsquo;s Value?</em> Bound at execution time</li>
</ul>
<p>A <strong>static binding</strong> refers to when a binding occurs before run time begins, and remains unchanged throughout execution. Whereas a <strong>dynamic binding</strong> refers to when a binding occurs during runtime or can change through the course of it&rsquo;s execution.</p>
<h3 id="static-type-binding">Static Type Binding</h3>
<p>Two types of declaration: <em>Explicit declaration</em>, when there exists a statement in a program that lists variable names and specifies they are a particular type, and <em>Implicit declaration</em>, when you associate variables with types through default conventions, rather than declaration statements, using type inference. Think C++ (explicit) vs. Python (implicit).</p>
<h3 id="dynamic-type-binding">Dynamic Type Binding</h3>
<p>Here, the variable is bound to a type when it is assigned a value in an assignment statement. The variables type can change any number of times during execution.</p>
<p>Dynamic binding does have benefits, allowing for a more broadly built program for situations where the type of a value isn&rsquo;t relevant. However, this does present a few issues, as there now more potential for type errors, and is more costly leading to longer execution times.</p>
<p>Dynamic binding uses pure interpreters, while static bindings use compilers.</p>
<h3 id="storage-bindings--lifetime">Storage Bindings &amp; Lifetime</h3>
<p>A few terms to understand:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Allocation</strong>: the process in which a memory cell is bound to a variable from a pool of available memory</li>
<li><strong>Deallocation</strong>: the process of placing a memory cell that has been unbound from a variable back into the pool</li>
<li><strong>Lifetime</strong>: The time during which the variable is bound to a specific memory location.</li>
</ul>
<p>We can break down scalar variables into four different categories based off their lifetime, Static, Stack-Dynamic, Explicit Heap-Dynamic, &amp; Implicit Heap-Dynamic.</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Static Variables</em>: One that is bound to a memory cell before program execution begins &amp; remains bound to that same memory cell until program execution terminates
<ul>
<li>Overall these are most useful as global variables, accessed across the program without changing</li>
<li>They&rsquo;re efficient, addressing is direct so the cost of run time is low, and there&rsquo;s no run time overhead for allocation/deallocation</li>
<li>Unfortunately this leads to reduced flexibility, no ability for recursion over them, and storage cannot be shared amongst variables</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Stack Dynamic Variables</em>: Those whose storage bindings are created when their declaration statements are elaborated, but whose types are statically bound
<ul>
<li>When the storage allocation &amp; binding process occur based off of a declaration, usually run-time</li>
<li><strong>Stack dynamic variables are allocated from run-time stack</strong></li>
<li>This allows for recursive subprograms</li>
<li>Downsides are the run-time overhead of allocation/deallocation, slower access, and subprograms cannot be history sensitive</li>
<li>C, C++, &amp; Java use dynamic-stack variables as default for method calls</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Explicit Heap-Dynamic Variables</em>: nameless (or abstract) memory cells that are allocated &amp; deallocated by explicit run-time instructions written by the programmer
<ul>
<li>These can only be referenced via pointers or reference variables</li>
<li>Bound to a type at compile time, which is static</li>
<li>Bound to storage during run-time</li>
<li>These are often used to construct dynamic strucures</li>
<li>However, using pointers &amp; reference variables correctly can be challenging, and storage can be complex</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Implicit Heap-Dynamic Variables</em>: Bound to heap storage only when they are assigned values, all attributes are bound every time they are assigned
<ul>
<li>Ex: <code>highs = [74, 84, 86, 90, 71]</code>
<ul>
<li>Regardless of it&rsquo;s actually used or not, <code>highs</code> is now an array of numeric values</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Of all types, implicit heap-dynamic variables have the highest degree of flexibility and highly generic looking (good thing)</li>
<li>There is a cost for all of the run-time overhead maintaining all dynamic variables, and there is a loss of error detection on the compiler side</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>
<p><em>Scope</em> is formally defined as the range of statements in which a variables if visible, or if it can be referenced or assigned.</p>
<p><em>Static scope</em> is the method of binding names to nonlocal variables; the scope of a variable can be statically determined (prior to execution). Generally two categories; nested &amp; non-nested.</p>
<p><em>Static parent</em> is where the program or subprogram that declares a sub program inside it.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-Java" data-lang="Java"><span style="display:flex;"><span>function <span style="color:#a6e22e">big</span>(){

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>	<span style="color:#66d9ef">var</span> x <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> 3;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>	sub1();
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In the above example, the <code>x</code> inside function <code>sub2</code> is actually going to be equal to 3, not 7. New static scopes can be defined during code execution in some languages.</p>
<h3 id="blocks">Blocks</h3>
<p><em>Blocks</em> are sections of usually stack dynamic variables; storage is allocated when the section ins entered, and deallocated when exited.</p>
<p><strong>Declaration Order</strong>: In some languages, all data declarations must occur in the beginning of the function. Others, don&rsquo;t care so much. Certain languages will not allow the use of a variable before it&rsquo;s declaration.</p>
<p><em>C++ and Java?</em> The scope of all local variables if from their declarations to the ends of the blocks in which those declarations appear.</p>
<p>Some variables have a <em>global scope</em>, which means they are defined outside of functions (in main) which are potentially visible to other functions.</p>
<p>When we use the word <strong>declaration</strong>, we mean specifying types &amp; other attributes without allocation memory or storage. When we say <strong>definition</strong>, that actually specifies attributes <em>and</em> storage allocation.</p>
<p>Different languages have different ways of declaring a global variables. In C, <code>extern</code> can be used to make a global variables visible to a function if the variable is declared after the function. In C#, <code>::</code> is used to access global variables hidden by local variables. In PHP, all variables declared outside of a function is considered a global variables accessible in two ways;</p>
<ol>
<li>Function can create a variable of the same name in the function the <code>global</code> preceding it</li>
<li>Function can create a variable and use the <code>$GLOBALS</code> array with the subscript as the index</li>
</ol>
<p>In general, static scoping is unnecessarily complicated, hard to read, rigid, and overall awkward to use.</p>
<h3 id="dynamic-scoping">Dynamic Scoping</h3>
<p>Dynamic Scoping is based on the calling sequence of subprograms, not on spatial relationships between one another. <strong>Scope is determined at run times</strong>.</p>
<p>Evaluating dynamic scoping shows that it&rsquo;s overall less reliable than static scoping, due to local variable assignments not pointing to the correct place, an inability to type check references to non-locals statically, and are very hard to read.</p>
<h3 id="scope-and-lifetime">Scope and Lifetime</h3>
<p>Sometimes, a variables scope and lifetime are closely related. Even though they are separated, certain examples like a function with no parameters creating a variable, that variables scope &amp; lifetime are closely linked.</p>
<p>The <em>referencing environment</em> of a statement is a collection of all variables that are visible in the statement. In static-scoped languages, the reference environment is the variables declared in it&rsquo;s local scope plus the collection of all variables of it&rsquo;s ancestor scopes that are visible. Referencing environments are needed while compiling statements so the code and data structures can be created with correct references.</p>
