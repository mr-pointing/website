      <description>Unit 2: The Internet The internet is a global connection of computers communicating with one another. The constant flow of input and output keeps the internet going.&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s an open system, meaning anyone can join given they follow the proper protocols. These include but aren&amp;rsquo;t limited too:&#xA;IP: Protocol for identifying IP addresses with some routing strategy to send and receive information TCP/UDP: Protocols that transfer packets of data that check for errors along the route TLS: Protocol for encrypting data HTTP &amp;amp; DNS: Protocols for internet browsers Even though we likely use the internet everyday, a lot of these protocols are so far abstracted that we hardly have to think about these.</description>

      <description>Unit 1: Digital Information Most of this I should know, being a computer science teacher. However, outlining this should make teaching this rather boring portion easier. I want to try implementing more diagrams while I teach; I&amp;rsquo;ll be looking forward to stealing their ideas.&#xA;Bits and bytes How do computers represent data? All computers understand is Binary, 0&amp;rsquo;s and 1&amp;rsquo;s.&#xA;The video explains the example of using one single wire to transfer electricity through it; on or off.</description>
