            <div class="post-content">
                <hr>
<p>After going through <a href="http://localhost:1313/notes/computer-science/textbooks/programming-in-lua/the-basics/programming-in-lua---chapter-1/">Programming in Lua</a>, I started watching a video series on <a href="">learning Neovim</a>. It really got me wanting to try out Neovim, so I started with the tutor. I&rsquo;ll probably just throw in a few of the most important things I learn in each chapter of the tutor.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-1">Chapter 1</h2>
<ul>
<li>Moving can be done with the arrows or <code>h</code>, <code>j</code>, <code>k</code>, and <code>l</code> to move left, down, up, and right respectively</li>
<li>You can open any file in Neovim with <code>nvim FILENAME</code>.</li>
<li>Exiting Neovim is done with <code>:q!</code> to discard changes, and <code>:wq</code> to keep changes</li>
<li>Deleting characters outside of <code>insert</code> mode can be done with hitting <code>x</code></li>
<li>Entering <code>insert</code> mode can be done by hitting <code>i</code>
<ul>
<li>You can append to any line by hitting <code>A</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hitting <code>Esc</code> brings you back to <code>normal</code> mode</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="chapter-2">Chapter 2</h2>
<ul>
<li>The <code>delete</code> operator can be used to quickly get rid of words
<ul>
<li><code>dw</code> to delete from your cursor to the next word</li>
<li><code>d$</code> to delete from your cursor to the end of a line</li>
<li><code>dd</code> to delete an entire line</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You can use numbers before operators to repeat operations</li>
<li><code>w</code> moves word to word by the first letter
<ul>
<li><code>e</code> moves word to word by the last letter</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Change command syntax is as follows, <code>operator [number] motion</code></li>
<li><code>0</code> moves to the beginning of a line</li>
<li>Undo changes with <code>u</code>
<ul>
<li>Undo all changes to a line with <code>U</code>
<ul>
<li>Go forward in time with <code>Ctrl+r</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="chapter-3">Chapter 3</h2>
<ul>
<li>After deleting anything, you can put it anywhere with <code>p</code>, placing it after the cursor</li>
<li>Replace any character with <code>r</code> and the character you want</li>
<li><code>c</code> is the change operator; it replaces a section with putting you into <code>insert</code> mode to make changes
<ul>
<li><code>ce</code> or <code>c#e</code> will delete from the cursor to the end of the word or # amount of words</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="chapter-4">Chapter 4</h2>
<ul>
<li>If you want to display your current line location, you can with <code>Ctrl+g</code>
<ul>
<li><code>gg</code> brings your cursor to the first line</li>
<li><code>#G</code> brings your cursor to line number #</li>
<li><code>G</code> brings your cursor to the end of the file</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You can search for text using <code>/</code> and text to search forward in the file
<ul>
<li>You search backwards using <code>?</code></li>
<li>When searching, press <code>n</code> for the next occurrence and <code>N</code> for the previous</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Use <code>%</code> to bring your cursor to the opening or closing of a pair of brackets</li>
<li>Use <code>:s/old/new</code> to substitute the first occurrence of <code>old</code> with <code>new</code>
<ul>
<li>You can specify what lines you want to effect with <code>:#,#s</code></li>
<li>You can use <code>:s/old/new/g</code> to replace an entire lines <code>old</code> with <code>new</code></li>
<li>Use <code>:%s/old/new</code> to replace all <code>old</code> with <code>new</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="chapter-5">Chapter 5</h2>
<ul>
<li>You can use external commands using the <code>!</code> operator;
<ul>
<li><code>:!ls</code> will run <code>ls</code></li>
<li>Usually opens it up in a smaller window</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We can create new files easily with <code>:w FILENAME</code>, and just as easily remove it with <code>:!rm FILENAME</code></li>
<li>Traditional highlighting can be accomplished using <code>v</code> or <code>Visual Selection</code>
<ul>
<li>After highlighting a section of text, you can use <code>d</code> to simply delete the selection</li>
<li>You can even save and move selected text into a separate file, writing <code>:w FILENAME</code>
<ul>
<li>You&rsquo;ll notice after writing the <code>:</code>, some more characters appeared after it, <code>'&lt;, '&gt;</code>. I don&rsquo;t know why this happens, but it does let you know nicely that you are in some modifier mode</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You can retrieve and place the contents of any file using <code>:r FILENAME</code>
<ul>
<li>A cool trick is reading the output of external commands; you can use <code>:r !ls</code> to read in the output of <code>ls</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="chapter-6">Chapter 6</h2>
<ul>
<li>Open is a command you can use to insert a new line under or above an existing line
<ul>
<li>On a line, type <code>o</code> to insert a new line under the line your cursor exists on</li>
<li>Typing <code>O</code> will do the same but above the line your cursor is on</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You can append to any line
<ul>
<li><code>a</code> brings you to the end of the word of your cursor</li>
<li><code>A</code> brings you to the end of the line your cursor is on</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A new mode, <code>Replace</code> mode, can be entered not using <code>r</code>, but <code>R</code>. It works like <code>Insert</code> mode but replaces over characters instead of inserting them into the line</li>
<li>Copy using <code>y</code> and paste with <code>p</code>
<ul>
<li>You can use <code>v</code> to select and <code>y</code> to copy it</li>
<li>You could also use <code>yank</code> as an operator, like using <code>yw</code> to copy a word</li>
<li><code>P</code> places before your cursor instead of after</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The <code>:set</code> operator can be used to configure other commands
<ul>
<li><code>:set ic</code> ignores casing when searching</li>
<li><code>:set is</code> shows partial matches</li>
<li><code>:set hls</code> highlights all matching phrases
<ul>
<li>Use <code>no</code> in front of any of these options to switch them off</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
