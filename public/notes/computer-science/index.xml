      <description>A resource by Code Basics&#xA;We&amp;rsquo;ll see how this works. Starting in June of 2024, I plan to get myself prepared for a new career after another year of teaching. Pretty much; I want to find a job ideally that starts in the late summer of next year.&#xA;Week 0 is stupid lol.&#xA;Week 1 and 2 (6/2 - 6/17) I have a masters degree in this subject. I think I can handle a khan academy course and going through the entire Python documentation in two weeks.</description>
