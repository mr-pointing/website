      <description>Get Acquainted with PyCharm The project view is one of the main tool windows, containing the project directory, external libraries, and scratch files. You can also open it with Alt 1. The Python interpreter is easily viewable in the status bar in the bottom right. You can run, debug, or other option on the top right of the window. You can also press Shift F10. We got an unexpected error in our code, featured below.</description>

      <title>Formatting Percentages</title>

      <description>Modified: July 03 2024&#xA;7/3/2024&#xA;Taken from this article.&#xA;Often in projects, we want to format our large float types as smaller percentages.&#xA;There are three main ways to do this:&#xA;Rounding and Float/String Types: round() takes two parameters: a value and a number to round too. Then, we can use a little complicated string statement.&#xA;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; number = 0.8839133112 &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; n2 = round(number, 4) &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print(n2) 0.886 &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print(str(n2 * 100) + &amp;#39;%&amp;#39;) Format() Alternatively, if that seems a bit complicated, we can just format() instead.</description>

Starting in June of 2024, I plan to get myself prepared for a new career after another year of teaching. Pretty much; I want to find a job ideally that starts in the late summer of next year.&#xA;Week 0 is stupid lol.&#xA;Week 1 and 2 (6/2 - 6/17) I have a masters degree in this subject.</description>
