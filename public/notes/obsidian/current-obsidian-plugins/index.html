<h1 id="community-plugins">Community Plugins</h1>
<p>Community plugins keep some pieces of software alive. When development stops on a product, often the users can keep producing <em>forks</em> of the initial project and continue developing their own functions and uses for the app. In Obsidian&rsquo;s case, even while production is still going, they implore users to develop their own plugins to meet their own needs.</p>
<p>One thing should be stressed; community plugins should only be prioritized <em>after</em> learning the ins and outs of core Obsidian. Obsidian has tons of features, large and small, some we haven&rsquo;t gone over. Take your time to explore Obsidian before branching out.</p>
<h2 id="dataview">Dataview</h2>
<p>Dataview is an extremely powerful plugin. One so powerful, I barely understand how to use it. It&rsquo;s prime use is for creating more advanced tables than Obsidian allows you to create. I use this on my main tracking note to keep a list of all open un-checked boxes to appear at the beginning of the note. I have a note that goes over a video on how a beginner approach to <a href="http://localhost:1313/notes/obsidian/beginner-tutorial-for-obsidian-dataview/">Dataview</a>.</p>
<h2 id="excalidraw">Excalidraw</h2>
<p>I love Excalidraw. In my humble opinion, Excalidraw is a better version of the canvas feature with even more options. Two easy ways to open up a new Excalidraw file:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Ribbon gets an Excalidraw button after installing it</li>
<li>You can use the Command Palette to choose your option (new drawing, where to open it, how to show it, etc.)</li>
</ol>
<p>Excalidraw gives you lots of options to start new drawings. Through the command palette, you can get a look at how many things you can do. Sometimes you want to automatically <em>embed</em> your new drawing into your file, which has it&rsquo;s own action and hotkey. Sometimes the new drawing should appear in a new tab or window, which are both separate options.</p>
<p>Excalidraw offers shapes, lines for connection, a simple text editor with options for colors and customization, easy image integration, and even some presenting tools that are useful when going over complex data.</p>
<h2 id="style-settings">Style Settings</h2>
<p>Style settings does exactly what it sounds like it does; provides additional customization options. Without the style settings plugin, we could achieve the same customizations, but we&rsquo;d have to edit some files. Style settings saves us the trouble of rummaging through CSS editing and let&rsquo;s us do customizations within Obsidian.</p>
<h2 id="templater">Templater</h2>
<p>Templater is a plugin I use pretty much everyday. It&rsquo;s a more complex version of using regular templates, with some needed quality of life changes.</p>
<p>One feature that saves time is the startup template settings. I have templates that automatically apply properties and a horizontal rule to my notes. I even have it so that if it&rsquo;s a specific folder, it will notice and give a different template.</p>
<p>This is all achievable withy Templater&rsquo;s unique syntax to grab session variables. We can get easy things like the notes title, to more complicated structures like conditional statements.</p>
