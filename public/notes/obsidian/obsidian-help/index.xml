      <description>Core Plugins Out of the box, Obsidian has a plethora of usable features. Most you might never touch.

      <description>User Interface A user interface, otherwise referred to as a UI, is the visual parts of a program you interact with when using it. For Obsidian, the UI is the entire window. Let&amp;rsquo;s break it down piece by piece.&#xA;Appearance Before we go any further, we should go over the fun part. Making it your own. If your left bar isn&amp;rsquo;t already open, hit the button on the top left (it&amp;rsquo;s a little square with lines in it).</description>

      <description>Link to Documentation.&#xA;What is Obsidian? Essentially, a note-taking tool. All it boils down too is the format in which your notes are placed (I just think Obsidian is neat). Obsidian uses a Markdown, a markup-language. Not really a programming language, more of an encoding language, but we don&amp;rsquo;t need to worry about that for right now.&#xA;For now, all we are going to focus on is the basics-you have something you want to take notes on, and you write down your notes inside.</description>
