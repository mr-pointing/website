What is Obsidian? Essentially, a note-taking tool. All it boils down too is the format in which your notes are placed (I just think Obsidian is neat). Obsidian uses a Markdown, a markup-language. Not really a programming language, more of an encoding language, but we don&rsquo;t need to worry about that for right now.
For now, all we are going to focus on is the basics-you have something you want to take notes on, and you write down your notes inside. No (strict) syntax, no indenting, no errors, no worries. Unlike a standard document editor however (think Word) it lacks the ability and flare of the more powerful applications.

<h1 id="what-is-obsidian">What is Obsidian?</h1>
<p>Essentially, a note-taking tool. All it boils down too is the format in which your notes are placed (I just think Obsidian is neat). Obsidian uses a Markdown, a markup-language. Not really a programming language, more of an <em>encoding</em> language, but we don&rsquo;t need to worry about that for right now.</p>
<p>For now, all we are going to focus on is the basics-you have something you want to take notes on, and you write down your notes inside. No (strict) syntax, no indenting, no errors, no worries. Unlike a standard document editor however (think Word) it lacks the ability and flare of the more powerful applications.</p>
<p>Obsidian is meant to be lightweight. Not just as a software, but on out-of-the-box options as well. You start very simply, with hashtags and a weird looking is thing you can&rsquo;t really type. We&rsquo;ll get there.</p>
<p>Once you have a few notes, then we start to incorporate the <strong>Tag</strong> system, to give our notes more meaning. If our notes are alike, we can <strong>Link</strong> them as well, or even just for reference. You&rsquo;ll really begin to see the bigger picture once you open up <strong>Graph View</strong>, which shows the links and tags between your notes.</p>
<p>After you understand the lay of the land is when you can really start to take off. We haven&rsquo;t even touched on the customization aspect-easily the biggest selling point behind using it (besides the files being super easy to access). We can add in <strong>Themes</strong> to give it a more personalized look, or <strong>Plugins</strong> to completely change the experience. We&rsquo;re going to go over a few plugins this year for sure.</p>
