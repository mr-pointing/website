<p>What a beautifully written book. Of all the events that transpire, it&rsquo;s the writing that keeps me recommending The Secret History. The story is presented as a mix of a tragedy, a comedy, and a reflection of what powerful influence looks like on impressionable young people. The allure of Julian Morrow sets up a rock that rolls into a boulder, crushing those both caught in the trajectory and the ones behind the push.</p>
<p>Our characters are deeply flawed, starting at our main characters superficial need to be seen as a class above his own. Regardless of his actions or intentions, he is not and never will be apart of the class he so desperately chases after. Our supporting cast emphasizes all of the worst traits associated with elitism; over-consumption of liquor and prescription drugs, an uncaring disposition towards the lay people, and a cold, unrelenting criticism of the life everyone else exists in. Even the parties they themselves go to, they can&rsquo;t help but find fault in the people, the music, the energy their surrounded in. They don&rsquo;t see how regardless of their distaste, they are inevitably part of the society they so often disregard.</p>
<p>Our narrator often finds peace among the regular folks of Hampden. Richard sees how much fun everyone has being themselves, even if they aren&rsquo;t the epitome of high class society. He will eventually find something to gripe at, but it always starts with this sense of longing to be apart of it all. Almost like he wishes he was able to be satisfied by these simple pleasures. It wouldn&rsquo;t be much of a story if this simple logic made sense to our main character; he is constantly manipulated into falling deeper and deeper into the rabbit hole of Henry, Julian, and Camilla&rsquo;s influence. I believe Francis and Charles made long lasting impressions on Richard, but it&rsquo;s those pivotal three in which he finds the courage to take blind leaps of faith into their worlds.</p>
<p>Do I think Bunny deserved to die? Of course not. Do I think the cast had another way out? Of course they did. Unfortunately, I do think Henry&rsquo;s allure and influence caused the others to see the worst outcome as inevitable. Even if Julian had received the note and believed it, because the death of the farmer was so impersonal and wrapped up, I think Julian might have even been able to help or consult our characters to find a way through. Only after watching some YouTube videos and reading comments did I really notice the influence of Henry. I never made the connection that Charles hospital visits could have been attributed to Henry&rsquo;s concoctions. We know he did attempt to have Charles kill himself with pills; the former isn&rsquo;t that much of a stretch.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been telling people to read this under the context of a better Gatsby (I personally can&rsquo;t stand the book) with a more interesting setting and a group of characters who are aware of how much they suck. After finishing the book, I think that&rsquo;s half true. I still think it&rsquo;s a better Gatsby, but I don&rsquo;t think the cast is self aware at all. I think they believe in the illusion so hard (that they are part of the upper echelon) they are willing to lose themselves. All of our characters fall apart and find themselves intensely damaged by their actions in the Bacchai, and eventually by Bunnies death. Most of the cast are more concerned with getting caught than the death of their friend, but we all know the body keeps the score. Camilla falls even more into Henry&rsquo;s spell believing that even after death, he is the only one she can truly love. Francis dissociates so hard he tries to kill himself. Charles starts to lose his grip on reality as he falls harder and harder into his addiction to alcohol. Henry loses his god-like figure, and decides to end his life in front of his friends. While Richard views him as &ldquo;triumphantly&rdquo; going to his death, the act of traumatizing his closest friends is a cowardly act, pointing back to his comments on Julian&rsquo;s decision to leave the school. Both parties can be true.</p>
<p>Very solid 5 out of 5.</p>
