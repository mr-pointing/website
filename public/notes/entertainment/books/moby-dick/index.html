<p>What is the reason we write? I&rsquo;m not sure if that&rsquo;s the right way to start this review, but it was something that bothered me the entire time reading Moby Dick. What was the reason for all of this lexical analysis? Was there any benefit to my experience knowing the nitty gritty details of how whales are killed, dissected, and harvested for materials?</p>
<p>At first I thought it was meaningless; fluff to drive out the length of the novel. Fortunately, after finishing it and doing some more research, Herman&rsquo;s expansive diatribes are somewhat useful. At the time of publishing (1851) the knowledge of whales and their general species was largely misinformed. You don&rsquo;t have to go research to find that out, Ishmael literally tells you in great detail all of the faults of his modern-day understanding of the great leviathans. Part adventure story of course, but also part learning experience. I started to enjoy the longer chapters a little more when put into that perspective.</p>
<p>I never had the pleasure of reading Moby Dick in high school or anytime previously, but I know for a fact that I would have for sure thought Ishmael and Queequeg were in some type of relationship. Sitting in bed, foreheads connected, sharing a pipe? I know a good fan-fic when I see one. This also starts to make more sense as we reach the conclusion of our story. Obviously spoilers, but it seemed like Ishmael wrote the parts with Queequeg very purposefully. He writes of him fondly because he ends of dying, with the rest of the Pequod falling into a similar fate. Being the sole survivor of the crash, Ishmael has been writing this story out as a means of coming to peace with the death of his mates. Not just the crew of the Pequod, but his best mate, the man that took him in and shared his bed, pipe, and God with him. Really powerful stuff.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t come to this conclusion on my own obviously, as I would from time to time seek out chapter explanations from <a href="https://beigemoth.blog/moby-dick/">this</a> fantastic resource. I can&rsquo;t stress enough how nice this was, especially for the extremely information-dense chapters. Please give his blog a read!</p>
<p>The comment I received the most when people found out I was reading it was, &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Most people I spoke to about it had rough feelings about the classics, not seeing it as worth it when there are literally hundreds of good, interesting, and <strong>new</strong> books coming out every year. I&rsquo;m not going to give you any prolific answers here, just the truth. When reading or experiencing anything, and I come across a reference I don&rsquo;t understand, it irks me beyond belief. Moby Dick has been on my want to read list for years purely because it&rsquo;s such a well known book, and the only thing I knew about it was Ahab and the White Whale. The prose, witty quips, and emotion felt through the pages surprised me, and I&rsquo;m so happy I chose to give it a try.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll leave you with my favorite scene. Maybe the third or fourth-to-last chapters, <em>&ldquo;The Symphony&rdquo;</em>. Here, we reflect along with Ahab on our long journey. We are finally in the area of Moby Dick (even though he&rsquo;s been following us the entire time!) and Ahab is having a personal moment reflecting on how we got here. In that moment of beauty and serenity of the ocean, Ahad ponders what it would be like to turn around, go home and hang it all up.</p>
<p>Ahad reaches out to Starbuck, his closest mate, the one he almost shot and killed when thoughts of insurrection rounded their ugly head. He tells Starbuck about his feelings, giving us my personal favorite quote, <strong>&quot;&hellip;Close! stand close to me, Starbuck; let me look into a human eye; it is better than to gaze into sea or sky; better than to gaze upon God.&quot;</strong> Nothing is more important in life than the people we surround ourselves with; the people that we&rsquo;ve chose to share or very short time on planet Earth with. Ahab realizes this, but, it&rsquo;s clearly not enough, when the White Whale is spotted and the chase begins in earnest.</p>
