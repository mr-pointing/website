<p>Not remembering much from my initial watch of Blade Runner, I wasn&rsquo;t sure what to expect going into this one. I did really enjoy A Scanner Darkly by Dick, so I expected to like this one despite not knowing much. I was not disappointed, and after blowing through this in 2 days I can say I really enjoyed it.</p>
<p>The philosophical questions presented combined with the loose answers they provide were interesting and engaging enough for me to think about throughout the read. Trying to find the meaning for the actions and motivations of the characters, just to be given a major thematic question of &ldquo;Should we assign meaning to meaningless things&rdquo; halfway through got me good.</p>
<p>The characters were fun, I constantly over analyzed each sentence to see if there was some way to tell if a character were an android or not. I think the constant check for real vs. imitation makes the book stand out, especially for being written before the 70&rsquo;s. I did think it had a slow start, but once the action picked up and Deckard really started moving did I think it was a satisfying pay off. I gave it a 4 out of 5, and am even more excited for the next Philip K. Dick book I pick up.</p>
