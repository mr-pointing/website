Definitely a novella that took me too long to finish, and not really because I was enjoying it. More so because I didn&rsquo;t love Lift as a character. I was actually going to say I didn&rsquo;t hate their childish behavior, but typing that out I had a gut feeling I wasn&rsquo;t being honest with myself.
I really didn&rsquo;t like how childish Lift was. Maybe that was her point, but I didn&rsquo;t seem to grasp onto the story. Wendel, her spren, being a Squidward-type that doesn&rsquo;t want to go anywhere or do anything was a nice contrast, but I couldn&rsquo;t help feel sorry that we find out the character Wendel could have been with died in one of the earlier books, and was a more interesting character.

<p>Definitely a novella that took me too long to finish, and not really because I was enjoying it. More so because I didn&rsquo;t love Lift as a character. I was actually going to say I didn&rsquo;t hate their childish behavior, but typing that out I had a gut feeling I wasn&rsquo;t being honest with myself.</p>
<p>I really <em>didn&rsquo;t</em> like how childish Lift was. Maybe that was her point, but I didn&rsquo;t seem to grasp onto the story. Wendel, her spren, being a Squidward-type that doesn&rsquo;t want to go anywhere or do anything was a nice contrast, but I couldn&rsquo;t help feel sorry that we find out the character Wendel could have been with died in one of the earlier books, and was a more interesting character.</p>
<p>Stump, the random old woman, being a radiant was a nice twist, and finding out that Nale was a Herald the whole time did build out the universe in a satisfying way. I don&rsquo;t think that justifies this being it&rsquo;s own book. I think it could easily been it&rsquo;s own few chapters in <a href="http://localhost:1313/notes/entertainment/books/oathbringer/">Oathbringer</a> and I would have enjoyed it more. 3 out of 5 for me.</p>
