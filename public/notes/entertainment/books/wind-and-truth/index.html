<p><em><strong>Previously:</strong></em> <a href="https://mrpointing.com/notes/entertainment/books/rhythm-of-war/">Rhythm of War</a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really torn on this one. Part of my loved this book, and part of me hated it. I gave it a 4 out of 5, so I must&rsquo;ve liked it more than disliked; I still cannot get over the fact that it&rsquo;s actually done. To be honest, a lot of the reason I gave it a 4 instead of anything lower is that there couldn&rsquo;t possibly be the ending I know my heart wants. I want all of my favorite characters to come out not just good, but better, stronger (maybe even Kaladin/Shallan finally happening). Unfortunately, I am a realist.</p>
<p>I know it would be unlike the world already established by Sanderson to just give these characters everything and more. The last 4 books have been building up the fact that there is no way to defeat Odium; at least not in the Rosharian system. If Dalinar succeeded, I don&rsquo;t know what that would have accomplished. If anything, I am part of the group that thinks Dalinar won. Refusing to fight, knowing your mortality is on the line, to me is the highest form of resilience. I know there was more at stake than just Dalinar&rsquo;s life; it was the fate of the world within his hands. There must be something more than happened during his final meeting with Nohadon that we aren&rsquo;t seeing, that lead him down the thought process of taking the gambit. I think this will likely end up being part of another flashback in a future book.</p>
<p>My biggest fault with the book is the inability to fit every character&rsquo;s conclusion nice and neatly for this arc. I agree with people online that Dalinar&rsquo;s death was way too abrupt, and could have been given another chapter or two. He was of our central characters for five books, yet I feel as if he flitted off into the night without a sound. Perhaps that&rsquo;s how all of the characters in world feel.</p>
<p>Now that most of our characters are dead, far away, or trapped, there wasn&rsquo;t much of a connecting thread between them to give a satisfying conclusion. It was more so here&rsquo;s where everyone&rsquo;s at, see you next time (but next time in this case is a whole ass decade). If Sanderson is smart, one of his smaller novels in the coming years will feature one of our main Stormlight characters to give them their much needed screen time.</p>
<p>I was really hoping for some plot relevance for Rysn, but unfortunately that ended up as a dud and we got maybe 2 chapters. Again, Sanderson has not made up for the atrocity that was that Novella. I was willing to give him the benefit of the doubt if she became more plot relevant, but for now it will remain a mystery.</p>
