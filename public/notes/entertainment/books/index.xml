      <title>Fateful Triangle</title>

      <description>&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After deep reflection, I still lack the ability to properly give my feedback while remaining professional. This was an incredibly difficult read. Not only was it incredibly lengthy and full of citations and footnotes, it was dense with historical information and new vocabulary. I found myself looking up definitions, synopsis&amp;rsquo; of political parties and events, and having to watch numerous supplemental material to actually follow along. Was this a good thing? I like to think so; it drove me to research a lot on my own, and after 50 or so pages the prose and vocabulary became more tolerable. If only it didn&amp;rsquo;t take another 600 pages/3 months to finish it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Previous:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/notes/entertainment/books/dawnshard/&#34;&gt;Dawnshard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Wow. Completely floored that I was so captivated by this entry. I began as a book 4 hater; it felt like so much had been accomplished in the first three, what else could possibly happen to our cast of characters? Well, it turns out, a lot can happen and change, which is a recurring theme not only throughout this series, but especially in this one. Almost all of our main characters are going through internal and external factors that push them to make decisions, some life-altering, others not so much. What this installation does perfectly I think, is the pain and confusion that comes along with change.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Previous:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/notes/entertainment/books/oathbringer/&#34;&gt;Oathbringer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure who keeps telling Brando Sando to keep making Novellas, but whoever it is needs to actually &lt;em&gt;read&lt;/em&gt; them. I really can&amp;rsquo;t justify this being it&amp;rsquo;s own story. Even more than the first, this felt like a different type of filler. Filler with the audacity to be a hardcover.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My issues don&amp;rsquo;t come with the story at all really. I actually enjoyed Rysn, and thought every time she was on the page she felt real. She had valid concerns about being treated as a disabled person in a world not built for one. I loved these parts, and had never even considered before how impossible something like a wheelchair would be in a place without smooth paved roads. I even thought her ability to naturally lead her crew even though she was constantly anxious about it actually made sense. My issues come with how easily digestible this story is, and how it could&amp;rsquo;ve been condensed to take place in the interludes of Rhythm of War.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Ring</title>

      <description>&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One that&amp;rsquo;s been on my reading list since I was a kid and saw the dynamic spiral cover, Ring is the original book that inspired the prolific and perfectly-spoofed movie of the same name. Hearing this was a series made me nervous this wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be great, but I ended up enjoying it at some parts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It went by really fast. The main character was the &lt;em&gt;worst&lt;/em&gt; dude. Hated how much he clearly did not care about his wife and kids until he put them in danger. Spoiler alert, this guy has the worst gut instincts of all time. He of course becomes friends with the other worst character of all time, and unfortunately make a dynamic duo.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/notes/entertainment/books/do-androids-dream-of-electric-sheep/</link>

      <description>&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Not remembering much from my initial watch of Blade Runner, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure what to expect going into this one. I did really enjoy A Scanner Darkly by Dick, so I expected to like this one despite not knowing much. I was not disappointed, and after blowing through this in 2 days I can say I really enjoyed it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The philosophical questions presented combined with the loose answers they provide were interesting and engaging enough for me to think about throughout the read. Trying to find the meaning for the actions and motivations of the characters, just to be given a major thematic question of &amp;ldquo;Should we assign meaning to meaningless things&amp;rdquo; halfway through got me good.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Previous:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/notes/entertainment/books/words-of-radiance/&#34;&gt;Words of Radiance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Definitely a novella that took me too long to finish, and not really because I was enjoying it. More so because I didn&amp;rsquo;t love Lift as a character. I was actually going to say I didn&amp;rsquo;t hate their childish behavior, but typing that out I had a gut feeling I wasn&amp;rsquo;t being honest with myself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I really &lt;em&gt;didn&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em&gt; like how childish Lift was. Maybe that was her point, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to grasp onto the story. Wendel, her spren, being a Squidward-type that doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to go anywhere or do anything was a nice contrast, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help feel sorry that we find out the character Wendel could have been with died in one of the earlier books, and was a more interesting character.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Holy Moly. What a ride. This book took &lt;em&gt;FOREVER&lt;/em&gt; to finish. Exactly 3 months and a day to be exact. But it was so worth it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A true continuation from &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/notes/entertainment/books/words-of-radiance/&#34;&gt;Words of Radiance&lt;/a&gt;, this book follows the logical progression from where that book left off and really begins to open up the world. There are still lots of secrets left to unfold (Who is Wit? Who is the Cremling God that Lift meets in Edgedancer? What&amp;rsquo;s going to happen with Renarin? How is Odium going to exploit Taravangian? WHY DOESN&amp;rsquo;T KALADIN AND SHALLAN GET TOGETHER???) which has me very excited for the next two books.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Road</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Modified: July 14 2024&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I finished The Road a few days ago and I&amp;rsquo;ve reflected fondly on the experience. Slow burn isn&amp;rsquo;t the word I&amp;rsquo;d use; perhaps a slow agonizing death. Because by the end, I was emotionally exhausted. It asks a lot of you. Sit through the gray, dim world that the story takes place in. Hope to some God the end is worth it. In my opinion, I think it was.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Modified: July 02 2024&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I finished Words of Radiance two days ago, and it initially got a 4 out of 5. I loved the book. I really did, and was invested from start to finish.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It took me about 3 weeks (3 weeks and 3 days says Goodreads) and it really flew by. I enjoyed tackling such a huge tome of a novel.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The characters were awesome, even if I felt like the interlude characters could have been longer to make them a bit more memorable. I only remember maybe one of them, and it was Lift cause they had a really cool attitude and wanted to just eat some good food.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Modified: July 26 2024&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;26 short essays on the pieces/lines of code that shaped the modern understanding of computer science.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;6/3/24&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Halfway through, I think some of the stories are interesting. Some of the articles don&amp;rsquo;t go as deep as I think they could/should; some bring up gender/race for seemingly no reason&amp;hellip;others actually delve deeper into the politics of it encouragingly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I started &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/notes/topics-im-interested-in/&#34;&gt;Topics I&amp;rsquo;m Interested In&lt;/a&gt; because of this book pretty much.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
