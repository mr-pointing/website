<p>A philosophical endeavor to say the least, Thus Spoke Zarathustra was a tough read and an enlightening one. To start, this is a book I&rsquo;ve owned for many years. As a teenager, I had only a cursory understanding of who Nietzsche was, and was angsty/thought he had all the answers to my questions. It was exactly the opposite; I thought I knew what he was talking about, but I had not even a hint of a clue.</p>
<p>The prose is tough, at times extremely hard to follow. I don&rsquo;t love the book for this, the parable style writing makes the allegories and metaphors intangible with such a gap in knowledge of the context in which the text was written. If not for the end notes, reading this would have been a slog. Moments stood out, especially when it was a moment in which I actually understood what he was trying to say.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m walking away feeling better about my place in the world. I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s his intentions, but I felt most of his stories were interpretable enough to compare against my own life and feelings. Moreover, I can see how people can take his lessons and interpret them in all sorts of ways, not just deviously. It&rsquo;s no mistake that fascist ideologies found home in this text, using the &ldquo;Will to Power&rdquo; as a means of justifying their regime.</p>
<p>I found a good amount of this book to be insightful, some quotes I&rsquo;d even use beautiful to describe. Mostly though, there were ideas and concepts that have been with me for a while, not just following Zarathustra. I love life in spite of the great evils humans commit, just like Zarathustra. Like him, knowing that the church doesn&rsquo;t always have the best intention doesn&rsquo;t make him a harsh cynical, but sets him on his own path to find his own meaning. No doom and gloom, just growth and search for true meaning.</p>
<h2 id="quotes">Quotes</h2>
<p>&ldquo;But the awakened one, the knowing one, says: &lsquo;Body am I entirely, and nothing more; and soul is only the name of something about the body.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Truly, I too learned to wait and profoundly so, -but only to wait for <em>myself</em>&hellip;By diverse ways and windings I arrived at my truth; not by a single ladder did I mount to the height where my eye roves into my remoteness. And it was only reluctantly that I ever asked the way-that has always offended my taste! Rather I questioned and tried the ways themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One should not wish to enjoy where one has not given joy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not let yourselves be carried up, do not sit on the backs and heads of strangers! But you mounted a horse? You are not riding briskly up to your goal? Well, my friend! But your lame foot is also with you on horseback!&rdquo;</p>
