<p>What began as a search for a birthday gift for my mother, became a dive deep into the life of Jeannette Walls. In true Richie fashion, I picked the biggest downer I could&rsquo;ve picked for a happy birthday. Knowing nothing about the book, I had saw it a few times show up as a &ldquo;BookTok&rdquo; recommendation, and even appear on my mom&rsquo;s &ldquo;Want to Read&rdquo; list on her Goodreads account. Knowing that there was a book in common the both of us wanted to read, I didn&rsquo;t even bother reading the back before purchasing and gifting it to her.</p>
<p>After reading it, I think she very politely forgot about it. She actually gave it back to me, not realizing I was the one who gave it to her. Ouch. Turns out, after reading it, it makes perfect sense why she did.</p>
<p>The story behind Walls&rsquo; life is not for the feint of heart. It is clear she has been through hardships most people won&rsquo;t have to endure. Between moments of sharing the trauma her and her siblings went through, you can&rsquo;t help but wonder how she could have made it through all of that okay. The theme tries to answer this question time and time again throughout the almost 300 pages-persist, whether in spite of, or despite all odds. Pretty powerful stuff.</p>
<p>The issue I had with the memoir was not the content, but the method of writing. If you think I write matter-of-factly, just wait. She narrates everything happening without leaving much of anything to the imagination. Sometimes, going so far as to start to bore. Can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;d jump to pick up another story of hers. If reading actual events that transpired seemed dull, I can only imagine what her characters would be doing had she had the creative freedom to do whatever she wants. Had this been anything other than what it was, this would have joined the dropped list. Being that it only took me 3/4 days to finish it, I won&rsquo;t say I hated it, but I definitely won&rsquo;t be reading it again. Weak 2 out of 5.</p>
