<p>Ah man. Ten years of My Hero. Crazy to think of where I was at 10 years ago, in High School myself, seeing these characters grow. Grow up into being one of the most meh pieces of work I&rsquo;ve ever followed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to even think of where My Hero fell off for me. I want to say it was watching alongside the anime and not really loving it, to around the time Deku started to gain more powers, nothing ever really felt memorable enough to make me want to catch up. I ended up letting hundreds of chapters go by, just to catch up and read week to week for the last 20 or so chapters.</p>
<p>If anything, I felt like this could have ended years ago. The hype from this IP inflated it to a point where it could no longer be contained-the spin off manga and movies and appearances made these characters fall flat on their face. Instead of being a showcase of the reality of living in a world of heroes, the characters in reality weren&rsquo;t all that deep save for the villains. So much so they villains are the ones who leave the most lasting impact on the characters of the story (Urara is a good example of this).</p>
<p>I think it was really great art. I think the fight scenes were incredibly well drawn, and anything with Shigaraki was wicked. But the story wasn&rsquo;t sustainable enough for me to care long enough to stick around. I&rsquo;m happy it&rsquo;s finished, and I am semi-happy with the ending. If anything, I think him not getting married outright is silly considering all of the work put in to force their relationship, but at this point I don&rsquo;t care that much.</p>
