      <description>Goal Finish Portfolio prototype Accomplishments I was able to finish a basic prototype for the portfolio page but it kind of sucks.&#xA;I wanted to figure out an easy way to get the Instagram feed for the artist, but working with Meta&amp;rsquo;s API is almost as sucky as my portfolio page. So I honestly have my work cut out for me.&#xA;This has been a crazy 30 days. Technically more, but who&amp;rsquo;s counting?</description>

      <description>Goal Complete the manual entry form Accomplishments FINALLY completed the manual entry form!! I&amp;rsquo;ve been building this out for a while and I was nervous to commit to it since there were a few more moving parts than just a regular request/booking. Happy to say it&amp;rsquo;s done and it&amp;rsquo;s pretty close to completion. The next and hopefully last big hurdle is the creation of the portfolio page, and ending with the testing of the hosting and such.</description>

      <description>Goal Work on email formatting Finish search for bookings Look into pagination Accomplishments I finished the searching for the bookings table, and tweaked the functions around a bit. This time, instead of creating a second search function, I made a new parameter table that takes in the type of table you want to search from. This way, I can just create a second view for the page to view the bookings.</description>

      <description>Goal Accomplishments I got the search feature working! I honestly was pretty shocked at how easy it was to implement after I got past the initial hurdle of creating the correct SQL query.&#xA;Problems or Issues I had to change the SQL query that grabbed the search results to format it with the variables before trying to execute it. I think because I was using a question mark placeholder for both column and search term, it was messing up the column value with quotation marks.</description>

      <description>Goal Accomplishments I was able to get the progress from yesterday into a bit more of a tangible solution. Currently, in order to update the SQL table of when a booking has been confirmed, is when the embedded widget passes an event scheduled action, it will notify the window which will in turn send the scheduled events information to a Flask view. From there, I need to make another call using the events information unique identifier to retrieve the start time.</description>

      <description>Goal Accomplishments I worked for a bit yesterday and a lot today, so I&amp;rsquo;ll count them as one. I was able to implement some more font choices so we can narrow that down sooner rather than later, and was also able to work on the color scheme a bit.&#xA;Problems or Issues Today was a daunting experience. I was finally able to get the API connection with Calendly going, just to realize I&amp;rsquo;m getting into more unfamiliar territory.</description>

      <description>Goal Get current bookings page working Look into filtering requests/bookings Don&amp;rsquo;t want to have to refresh the page, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to constantly update as the user is typing. Results should only appear upon hitting enter. Accomplishments Current bookings was a lot easier now that I&amp;rsquo;m using a template for all my pages, and it was a breeze to create a new blueprint for the page since it&amp;rsquo;s even less code than the requests page, due to their not needing to handle any post requests.</description>

      <description>Goal Coming back from a few days to think about a game plan for the finish line, I think I can get something out and working by the end of these 30 days. Maybe.&#xA;Finish applying base.html to all pages Make the admin index page for current requests page for current bookings page for manual application form Finish CSS for pages Accomplishments Got a ton done today, and worked for probably over 2 hours.</description>

      <description>Goal Start working on HTML/CSS changes Finish reformatting HTML with base.html Accomplishments Surprisingly, got a decent amount done in just under an hour. I was able to complete the base.html file, and worked out some of the kinks of the formatting. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t look exactly like the Figma yet, but I want to make sure all of the HTML files have the base.html extension first.&#xA;Problems or Issues Next: Day 23</description>
