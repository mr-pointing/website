<p>Getting a lot done today; more so with understanding how the calendar features work for Fullcalendar. So far, I know I&rsquo;m going to use a Grid view, and I&rsquo;m currently able to place events anywhere with the limit set by the artist.</p>
<p>Some things I got done were the ability to only show times from 11am to 11pm to avoid crazy time placements, I was able to work on the request page to include an easy consent button, and moved the artist&rsquo;s temporary schedule into a JSON file.</p>
<p>I also moved the dummy email and password in after switching to an app password (see below) and started using Yagmail. Not only is my code a little cleaner, but I also understand a lot more of it since I&rsquo;m the one who wrote it. Not very complex, but I understand what&rsquo;s happening a little clearer and I don&rsquo;t have to deal with forgetting to renew my credentials.</p>
<h1 id="problems-or-issues">Problems or Issues</h1>
<hr>
<p>I ran into the issue where since the Oauth2 consent is only available for a limited time, I was up against a wall for almost a half hour trying to figure out why my email features weren&rsquo;t working. Because of that, I just said screw it, used two-factor authorization for my test Gmail, and made an app password. With that, I can keep that in the <code>artist_info.json</code> file so I don&rsquo;t commit any passwords. This way, there is no pesky expiration date.</p>
<p>I ran into an issue where I thought I could nicely use Jinja to insert the client information and use it for making events in the calendar. I could, I just didn&rsquo;t realize I needed to add <code>| tojson</code> in order for it to work.</p>
<p>An issue currently with the calendar is that a client can potentially make the booking on an unavailable day, or a day where the entire time slot is taken.</p>
<p>A huge issue I realized with this calendar feature is that I don&rsquo;t know JavaScript at all. The process for this project has been usually me going as far as I can, run into a wall, see if I can fix it (have been able to fix a decent amount by myself actually), and if not run it through Google then AI. Google has been able to give me some help, but for the JavaScript AI has been a big help. After this project I think I&rsquo;m going to have to spend some more time learning basic JavaScript.</p>
