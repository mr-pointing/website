      <description>Goal From Yesterday:&#xA;Accomplishments I looked more into Twilio and it seems like they have their own API that can be used to make sure it&amp;rsquo;s compliant with their rules.

If they don&amp;rsquo;t say yes, the database save will not include the phone number, save it as None, and text message reminders won&amp;rsquo;t be sent to them.</description>

I had misunderstood the need for a &amp;ldquo;fast form&amp;rdquo;, it really should just be a button that sends a booking form that she fills out the request details and customer information for.</description>
