      <description>Goal Get Calendly to prefill info for booking link Accomplishments I really thought todays goal was going to be harder, but it actually ended up being pretty easy. All I had to do was edit the URL and pass in some parameters. I thought maybe I&amp;rsquo;d have to set up a developer account and use JSON/JavaScript, but honestly it seems fine without it?&#xA;Problems or Issues Next: Day 22</description>

      <description>Goal Correctly sync the booking form to choose which type of session Caret drop down menu &amp;amp; link to appropriate function Small Tattoo Session Medium Tattoo Session Large Tattoo Session Small Tattoo Reschedule Medium Tattoo Reschedule Tattoo Touchup Accomplishments Got a ton done today; walked through the Figma with Big Boss and was able to get going on the layout. Promising results on that front shortly.&#xA;I was able to get the quick note I made down below finished pretty quick, and glad I did since that will help out immensely when I start building out the search/filter feature.</description>

      <description>Goal Finish the Figma for site Mess around on Calendly Accomplishments Finished the preliminary wireframe for the site, handed off to big boss So another rejection as far as my current layout for the site. I was able to get started and get an actual calendar embedded into the site which worked nicely. I now have a new slew of issues to worry about;&#xA;There are 3 types of bookings to account for Normal tattoo sessions, three types Small (&amp;gt;2hrs) Medium (2 - 5hrs) Large (5+hrs) Reschedules Small (2hrs) Medium (3hrs30) Touchups (1hr30) Change Admin&amp;rsquo;s booking page to choose which type of session Booking should generate and save a link to it in the SQLite database for use later Artist can send via dm with info already filled out Figure out how to give Calendly forms pre-saved information Problems or Issues Next: Day 20</description>

      <description>Goal Goals for today are quite simple; complete the look of the website on Figma, so the boss can come in and make design changes before I start committing any time towards building in HTML/CSS. I&amp;rsquo;m building out a basic skeleton for her to build off of, and I should be able to finish that today.&#xA;As far as the project is coming along, since we are moving away from using Full Calendar, I think we&amp;rsquo;re going to just integrate with Calendly.</description>

      <description>Goal First day back!&#xA;I was sick for maybe 2, 3 weeks? Probably the worst cold I&amp;rsquo;ve had in my life, and of course it happened in the midst of my 30 day challenge. I almost tried to work through it, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t focus at all and had to stop completely. Instead of calling it quits though, I&amp;rsquo;m going to start Day 17 over as a new day, and try and get back up on the saddle.</description>

      <description>Goal Honestly, I might be taking a small break today? I mostly wanted to get the ball rolling this week but after yesterday, I think I might have to settle for Calendly integration before trying to re-create their services. The Twilio account rejected my verification again, and after trying to build a working calendar system through JavaScript, I realized two things; I suck at JavaScript and don&amp;rsquo;t know what I&amp;rsquo;m doing, and Twilio has everything I&amp;rsquo;m looking for plus a little more.</description>

      <description>Goal From Yesterday:&#xA;Set up text message for request Client Artist Integrate with Google Calendar For Today:&#xA;Change calendar to full month and change the formatting Had a talk with the boss, and she wants it to look a little bit different than the week-hour grid I had going on. Instead, I need each date to be clickable when available, and when clicked, needs to open up a little window in front with the available times.</description>
