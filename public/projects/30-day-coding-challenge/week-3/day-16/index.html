<p>Honestly, I might be taking a small break today? I mostly wanted to get the ball rolling this week but after yesterday, I think I might have to settle for Calendly integration before trying to re-create their services. The Twilio account rejected my verification <em>again</em>, and after trying to build a working calendar system through JavaScript, I realized two things; I suck at JavaScript and don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m doing, <strong>and</strong> Twilio has everything I&rsquo;m looking for plus a little more. Until I have enough free time to actually justify spending time trying to build a calendar system, I&rsquo;d rather go for the faster approach, then come back later and see if there&rsquo;s anything I can implement myself.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to not see this as a failure, since if anything now I know a little more about my strength&rsquo;s and weaknesses. I was already aware I wasn&rsquo;t great at front-end to begin with, but I need a lot more to go before I could reasonably teach or claim to understand really crucial concepts that were necessary to get the calendar working.</p>
