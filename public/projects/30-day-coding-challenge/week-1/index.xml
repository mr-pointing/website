      <description>Goal From Yesterday:&#xA;Format the Email back to client Accomplishments I didn&amp;rsquo;t get to work on this project much this weekend, and honestly I feel kind of okay about it? I am going to be putting off the AI roadmap on hold until this month is over to see if that helps with my workflow. This week I tried to do both and it left me really wanting to pick one over the other, so perhaps I&amp;rsquo;ll just leave the AI roadmap stuff on the back burner while I work hard on the next few days.</description>

      <description>Goal From yesterday:&#xA;Test email sending/receiving Format the Email back to client Accomplishments Today was a very busy work day, so I really didn&amp;rsquo;t get that far on anything. The biggest thing I did was I was able to locate the right documentation to help out with the next few steps. Otherwise, not a whole lot got done today.&#xA;Problems or Issues When running the Gmail quickstart code, I neglected to realize you would need to change the SCOPE list variable to allow more authorizations.</description>
