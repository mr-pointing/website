<p>Lython is my final project for my Masters program. I based it off an idea I had of giving my students a filtered AI, which branched off into editing ChatGPT with prompt filtering. Seeing that alone was particularly easy, I looked into implementing RAG, which works kind of.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/mr-pointing/Lython_GCU">Github</a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to continue working on my project as an actual tool to use during class. I&rsquo;d like to be able to launch it to a production server, so my students can access it during class. That way, I can cut the websites to just Lython, and the website they need to submit their assignments on.</p>
<p>So far, I was able to get it downloadable as a PyPI project. Previously I was happy with it being live on their Test server, being on production felt super cool.</p>
<p>8/23/2024</p>
<p>Decently big steps, I was able to host Lython on Python Anywhere, which was really difficult for some reason but so worth it. It&rsquo;s hosted <a href="https://mrxpointing.pythonanywhere.com">here</a> but it&rsquo;s down most of the time. I plan to use it there during the school year so my students have their own ChatGPT. If it&rsquo;s during the school year please try it out :).</p>
