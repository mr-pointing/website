<p>I was listening to a podcast from <a href="https://realpython.com/">Real Python</a> that mentioned getting your hands on a Circuit Playground Express. It was in passing and I probably wouldn&rsquo;t have ordered one, had I not seen one for sale at Micro Center for only $30.</p>
<p>From my understanding, it&rsquo;s a very basic introduction to using circuit boards, and I got it mostly because of something called <a href="https://circuitpython.org/">Circuit Python</a>, which is a version of Python meant to introduce students and beginners into controlling single board computers (SBC&rsquo;s).</p>
<p><a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-circuit-playground-express">Link</a> to the documentation.</p>
<p>So, of course, the circuit playground I bought has one of it&rsquo;s speakers blown. Not the biggest deal. As I went through the documentation I kept thinking to myself that this is pretty much an extremely basic Flipper. That might end up being my project for this thing; attach some Bluetooth capabilities to it to get it up to Flipper level.</p>
