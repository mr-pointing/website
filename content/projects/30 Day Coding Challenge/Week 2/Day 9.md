# Goal
---
From Last Week:
- [x] Format the Email back to client

For Today:
- [x] Set up email to Client w/ request form
- [x] Set up email to Admin saying there's a new request w/ client info
- [ ] Set up text messages for both


# Accomplishments
---
I was able to get a decent chunk of things today for today. One thing that I'm trying to to stress is the prettification of all of my elements. I got the emails working, but they look like crap. I am slightly worried when it comes time to use HTML to build them, they might break, but for now I'll try not to let it stress me out. 

Right now, the email functionality works, sending to both the client and the artist. Another feature I might try to implement today is for the artist credentials, so I can use a separate file and not commit people's personal email addresses. 


# Problems or Issues
---
Tried setting up a system using [Yagmail](https://github.com/kootenpv/yagmail/blob/master/README.md), which seemed to be an extremely easier version of what I was already using. I was getting a weird error where it wouldn't accept my credentials, so I'll continue using the method I've already implemented. If that stops working, I'll try to use Yagmail again.
