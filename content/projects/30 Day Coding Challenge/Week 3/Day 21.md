# Goal

- [x] Get Calendly to prefill info for booking link


# Accomplishments
---
I really thought todays goal was going to be harder, but it actually ended up being pretty easy. All I had to do was edit the URL and pass in some parameters. I thought maybe I'd have to set up a developer account and use JSON/JavaScript, but honestly it seems fine without it?
