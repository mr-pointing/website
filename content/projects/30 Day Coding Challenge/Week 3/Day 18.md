# Goal
---
Goals for today are quite simple; complete the look of the website on Figma, so the boss can come in and make design changes before I start committing any time towards building in HTML/CSS. I'm building out a basic skeleton for her to build off of, and I should be able to finish that today.

As far as the project is coming along, since we are moving *away* from using Full Calendar, I think we're going to just integrate with Calendly. Two main reasons why I did this; 

1. Boss is already using/paying for it, and it handles integration with Google Calendar and Stripe payment, so it kills many birds with one stone
2. We decided if I want to take this in a direction of having multiple tattoo artist clients, I could upgrade to an enterprise account on Calendly for only $5 more, and it would be more cost effective

I'm mostly worried that relying on Calendly for a lot of the work will make my product less fancy, but at this point I'd just like to finish it. I have lots of big plans for this year, so just having a completed project I can come back to once I know more JavaScript sounds promising.
