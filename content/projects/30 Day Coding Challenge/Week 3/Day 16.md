# Goal
---
Honestly, I might be taking a small break today? I mostly wanted to get the ball rolling this week but after yesterday, I think I might have to settle for Calendly integration before trying to re-create their services. The Twilio account rejected my verification *again*, and after trying to build a working calendar system through JavaScript, I realized two things; I suck at JavaScript and don't know what I'm doing, **and** Twilio has everything I'm looking for plus a little more. Until I have enough free time to actually justify spending time trying to build a calendar system, I'd rather go for the faster approach, then come back later and see if there's anything I can implement myself.

I'm trying to not see this as a failure, since if anything now I know a little more about my strength's and weaknesses. I was already aware I wasn't great at front-end to begin with, but I need a lot more to go before I could reasonably teach or claim to understand really crucial concepts that were necessary to get the calendar working.
