# Goal
---
First day back! 

I was sick for maybe 2, 3 weeks? Probably the worst cold I've had in my life, and of course it happened in the midst of my 30 day challenge. I almost tried to work through it, but I couldn't focus at all and had to stop completely. Instead of calling it quits though, I'm going to start Day 17 over as a new day, and try and get back up on the saddle.

I have a lot of ideas planned for 2025, so accomplishing this is a small but important step in my goals for the year.


# Accomplishments
---
To start off slow, I want to start using figma to help with the design of the pages. I haven't used Figma that earnestly before, so I'm going to spend the day watching a couple tutorials on what to do and how to best go about setting up the page.
