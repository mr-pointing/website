# Goal
---
- [x] Finish the Figma for site
- [x] Mess around on Calendly


# Accomplishments
---
- Finished the preliminary wireframe for the site, handed off to big boss 

So another rejection as far as my current layout for the site. I was able to get started and get an actual calendar embedded into the site which worked nicely. I now have a new slew of issues to worry about;

1. There are 3 types of bookings to account for
	1. Normal tattoo sessions, three types
		1. Small (>2hrs)
		2. Medium (2 - 5hrs)
		3. Large (5+hrs)
	2. Reschedules
		1. Small (2hrs)
		2. Medium (3hrs30)
	3. Touchups (1hr30)
2. Change Admin's booking page to choose which type of session
3. ~~Booking should generate and save a link to it in the SQLite database for use later~~
	1. Artist can send via dm with info already filled out
	2. Figure out how to give Calendly forms pre-saved information
