***Work Time:*** 1hr 20

Not my best day, but to be expected. Today wasn't one of my best days, so I shouldn't be too hard on myself.

# Problems or Issues
---

I ran into a wall with trying to get images to be displayed; I couldn't configure how to properly store images sent from the user into databases. After google, AI, and back-tracking, I called it quits for the day.

I did see however in a few [articles](https://medium.com/@anissalopez/storing-images-in-sqlite-database-with-flask-and-encoding-decoding-images-to-base64-to-send-to-fc7b3cc6f6b0) that using images in a database might take up too much space and make the database run slow, so I'm going to try another method.
