# Goal
---
From yesterday:
- [x] Test email sending/receiving
- [ ] Format the Email back to client


# Accomplishments
---

Today was a very busy work day, so I really didn't get that far on anything. The biggest thing I did was I was able to locate the right documentation to help out with the next few steps. Otherwise, not a whole lot got done today.

# Problems or Issues
---
When running the Gmail quickstart code, I neglected to realize you would need to change the `SCOPE` list variable to allow more authorizations. I spent way too long yesterday getting a validation error.
