***Work Time:*** 1hr 30

I got a lot done today, or at least it feels like it. First up, I messed around with the CSS Cursor gave me and tried to play with the setting up of the text entry fields for the requests. That went by smoothly, but I wanted to look into how I could use conditionals to retrieve different question fields. 

I initially thought this could be achieved with Flask, but it seemed like a lot of extra work to have to reload the page depending on what option the user picked. Instead, ChatGPT recommended me using JavaScript, which I am super unfamiliar with. It introduced me to the concept of having your fields appear and reappear depending on a radio button option. Really neat stuff.

Then, I went through and tested out the submitting of the requests. That went decently, except I had a few issues with the images getting lost sometimes. To fix it, I just had to change the name of one of the reference fields and it worked just fine.
