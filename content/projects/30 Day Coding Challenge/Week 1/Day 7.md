# Accomplishments

I didn't get to work on this project much this weekend, and honestly I feel kind of okay about it? I am going to be putting off the AI roadmap on hold until this month is over to see if that helps with my workflow. This week I tried to do both and it left me really wanting to pick one over the other, so perhaps I'll just leave the AI roadmap stuff on the back burner while I work hard on the next few days.
