# Accomplishments

***Work Time:*** 1hr 45 

So today was the first day and I feel like I was able to make some pretty decent progress. I created a really simple step-by-step guide to keep me on track, and to make the scope less creepy. I also was able to get a working schema for my tables, and I currently have `user` for Sarah, `client` for all people who book, and a `requests` for initial requests. I'm not sure if I'll have a separate table for full bookings or not, who knows.

I got the request form appearing, but I didn't finish editing it to how I want it to look. 

# Problems or Issues
---
I had a weird issue in PyCharm where it wasn't picking up my templates folder, so I remade the project in a new environment and decided to *not* use PyCharm's built in defaults for Flask apps. It wouldn't let me start with a separate directory, so without it I can and it works a lot better.
