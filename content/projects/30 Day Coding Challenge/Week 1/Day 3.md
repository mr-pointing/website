***Work Time:*** 2 hours

While I didn't get that much done as far as my lists are concerned, I was able to get a lot done today. I had to make all of the logging in and out features, as well as the pages for it and viewing all the requests. I was able to work it out nicely so all Sarah has to do is change the ending of the URL to get to the log-in form, and people are tempted to mess around with it. 

Viewing them currently doesn't look great, and I haven't been able to get the images up yet. That being said I haven't actually tried getting them out, but I looked it up and it seems pretty straightforward. What I might have to build once this gets grander scheme, is a way to limit the requests and keep them in pages so I don't have to attempt to grab and generate hundreds of images on a page load.
