# Accomplishments
---
***Work Time:*** 1hr

So far so okay. I was able to finally get the images working, but I had to rely on ChatGPT for help since none of the videos I watched were able to really help. I also dived into docs but couldn't really find what I was looking for. So for today, I'm going to have to be happy with what I got done, and call it till tomorrow, where I'll give a shot at multiple images and the email function.


# Problems or Issues
---

I wasn't able to get multiple pictures to upload, but I think that might have something to do with the logic I'm using.

When trying to upload two images, I got one only, so I think I might have to check use a loop/list structure to save multiple files grabbed from the request. That, or I can just have three file fields that I can just loop through instead.
