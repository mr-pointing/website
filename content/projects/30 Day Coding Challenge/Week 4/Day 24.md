# Goal
---
- [x] Get current bookings page working
- [ ] Look into filtering requests/bookings
	- [ ] Don't want to have to refresh the page, but it doesn't need to constantly update as the user is typing. Results should only appear upon hitting enter.


# Accomplishments
---
Current bookings was a lot easier now that I'm using a template for all my pages, and it was a breeze to create a new blueprint for the page since it's even less code than the requests page, due to their not needing to handle any `post` requests.


# Problems or Issues
---
I spent some time making an filter function for the SQLite tables, but don't feel confident in using them yet. I need to spend a little more time looking into this before I settle on what to do.
