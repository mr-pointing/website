# Accomplishments
---
I worked for a bit yesterday and a lot today, so I'll count them as one. I was able to implement some more font choices so we can narrow that down sooner rather than later, and was also able to work on the color scheme a bit.


# Problems or Issues
---
Today was a daunting experience. I was finally able to get the API connection with Calendly going, just to realize I'm getting into more unfamiliar territory. This time, I have to learn a bit about webhooks and how I can implement them to update my SQLite table when a booking is made. It seems like I have two options; I can use webhooks and figure out how that works, or I can find out how to get the response from the embedded widget. The webhooks seem like the better response long term.
