# Goal
---
- [x] Start working on HTML/CSS changes
- [ ] Finish reformatting HTML with  `base.html`


# Accomplishments
---

Surprisingly, got a decent amount done in just under an hour. I was able to complete the `base.html` file, and worked out some of the kinks of the formatting. It doesn't look exactly like the Figma yet, but I want to make sure all of the HTML files have the `base.html` extension first.
