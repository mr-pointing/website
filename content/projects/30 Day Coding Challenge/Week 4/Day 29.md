# Goal
---
- [x] Complete the manual entry form


# Accomplishments
---
**FINALLY** completed the manual entry form!! I've been building this out for a while and I was nervous to commit to it since there were a few more moving parts than just a regular request/booking. Happy to say it's done and it's pretty close to completion. The next and hopefully last big hurdle is the creation of the portfolio page, and ending with the testing of the hosting and such.

I'm 100% going to try and host this site with a raspberry pi. Not sure how that will work, but I definitely don't want to host another website using Python Anywhere.
