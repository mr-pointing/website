# Goal

# Accomplishments
---
I got the search feature working! I honestly was pretty shocked at how easy it was to implement after I got past the initial hurdle of creating the correct SQL query. 



# Problems or Issues
---
I had to change the SQL query that grabbed the search results to format it with the variables before trying to execute it. I think because I was using a question mark placeholder for both column and search term, it was messing up the column value with quotation marks. Now, it's working just fine.

I had an issue with the page refreshing and asking for submission, but after tinkering for a while I got no where and am going to leave it for now.
