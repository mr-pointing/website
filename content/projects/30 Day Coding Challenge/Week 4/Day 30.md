# Goal
---
- [x] Finish Portfolio prototype


# Accomplishments
---
I was able to finish a basic prototype for the portfolio page but it kind of sucks. 

I wanted to figure out an easy way to get the Instagram feed for the artist, but working with Meta's API is almost as sucky as my portfolio page. So I honestly have my work cut out for me.

This has been a crazy 30 days. Technically more, but who's counting?
