# Goal
---
Coming back from a few days to think about a game plan for the finish line, I think I can get something out and working by the end of these 30 days. Maybe.

- [x] Finish applying `base.html` to all pages
- [x] Make the admin index
	- [x] page for current requests
	- [ ] page for current bookings
	- [ ] page for manual application form
- [ ] Finish CSS for pages


# Accomplishments
---
Got a ton done today, and worked for probably over 2 hours. I was able to extend the `base.html` to all files needed, and differentiated between admin and client-side facing pages with the creation of the `admin_base.html` file. Not much different, but eventually I may split the stylesheets as well to really separate them.

I have a good amount to do, and just with what I got done today, I will probably be working on this way longer than the 30 days.
