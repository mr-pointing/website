I was listening to a podcast from [Real Python](https://realpython.com/) that mentioned getting your hands on a Circuit Playground Express. It was in passing and I probably wouldn't have ordered one, had I not seen one for sale at Micro Center for only $30. 

From my understanding, it's a very basic introduction to using circuit boards, and I got it mostly because of something called [Circuit Python](https://circuitpython.org/), which is a version of Python meant to introduce students and beginners into controlling single board computers (SBC's).

[Link](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-circuit-playground-express) to the documentation.

So, of course, the circuit playground I bought has one of it's speakers blown. Not the biggest deal. As I went through the documentation I kept thinking to myself that this is pretty much an extremely basic Flipper. That might end up being my project for this thing; attach some Bluetooth capabilities to it to get it up to Flipper level.
