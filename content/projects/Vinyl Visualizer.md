A passion project I'd like to make. It would be my first time using hardware and software together. 

To start, I'd like to grab a raspberry pi with a screen and audio in so it can display the record cover, the title, artist, and duration that updates as the song goes on.

I first asked [ChatGPT 3.5](https://chatgpt.com/share/ec6a257c-6e65-4364-b964-c66f437d005c) for advice.

I also asked [ChatGPT 4o](https://chatgpt.com/share/7c70547a-f544-4dd5-a80a-b645661ac905) and got a little better/pointed advice. Not much different though. It gave me advice on the script without asking. 

Hardware:

[The Raspberry Pi](https://www.canakit.com/raspberry-pi-5-8gb.html?cid=USD&src=raspberrypi)

[Raspberry Pi Guidebook](https://www.canakit.com/official-raspberry-pi-beginners-guide-5th-edition.html)

[Raspberry Pi Screen](https://www.canakit.com/raspberry-pi-lcd-display-touchscreen.html)

Software:

[AudD](https://audd.io/), an API that should help collecting data

[PyAudio](https://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/pyaudio/docs/), to help collect audio from the microphone

[Python GUI](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tk.html) info
