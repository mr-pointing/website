Building a Homelab is easier and more affordable than ever before. 

You can start homelabbing with extra tech or cloud options.

Clustering, through something like Kubernetes, you can start small. One small machine, and expand as you grow. All you need is a command line and 2gb of RAM.

Self hosting might need something more stable.

One way to start is with an old laptop. The creator started with one with just 4gb of RAM.

Linux runs almost anywhere with Ubuntu Server and Docker. I currently have ubuntu running on a virtual machine but haven't gotten very far other than basic command line instructional.

Not really into this option at the moment, mostly because I'm more interested in going the [Raspberry Pi NAS]({{< ref "Raspberry Pi NAS" >}}) route.

Oracle Free Tier has free cloud services. 32gb for free. Pretty much what I'm doing but getting into the things mentioned previously. 

Microsoft Azure is also an option, apparently you get $200 worth of credit when you sign up with your card and you don't get charged. 

Plugged his community which is $29 a month...a little pricey if you ask me. I bet if I threw up one for $1 a month people would subscribe because he has over 250 people paying him (probably ~ $6000?).
