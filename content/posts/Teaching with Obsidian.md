I'm not sure if it's obvious to everyone, but as a teacher I noticed that students do not know how to take notes. At best a student is writing something down, albeit not very good notes. Most are not taking any notes at all.

This is a small band-aid fix, but I'm going to start implementing Obsidian as a minor section of my curriculum this year. Online notes are not a replacement for good handwritten note-taking, but for my Computer Science Honors kids it's a good place to store code from lessons and start to think about what's really important.

There is no bad way to take notes, but taking no notes at all is certainly a worse alternative. They should be having fun and be excited to try something new that's beneficial to them. I'm also stepping away from letting my kids use PyCharm's code completion since they get too reliant on it, and will devote a few weeks on just getting more familiar with [using an IDE]({{< ref "PyCharm IDE Features" >}}). 

I only just started, but I've been working on going through the [Obsidian help documentation]({{< ref "Obsidian Help - Preface" >}}). It's a great way to structure a lesson plan and get's the kids writing right away. I don't know if I want to enforce a structure around note taking to get some grade to keep them doing it, or letting them just do there thing after the lessons are over and see if it sticks. Either way this year is looking to be a really exciting year!
