I finished Words of Radiance two days ago, and it initially got a 4 out of 5. I loved the book. I really did, and was invested from start to finish. 

It took me about 3 weeks (3 weeks and 3 days says Goodreads) and it really flew by. I enjoyed tackling such a huge tome of a novel. 

The characters were awesome, even if I felt like the interlude characters could have been longer to make them a bit more memorable. I only remember maybe one of them, and it was Lift cause they had a really cool attitude and wanted to just eat some good food.

I cheered on a few occasions, especially during the duels. I cried on two occasions; when Syl returns and when Kaladin saves the day and takes Szeth on. I loved Kaladin as a character and really hope the next book does him the justice he deserves. I also want to see more of Adolin, now that everyone around him is special excluding himself. Even Renarin is a Radiant, while Adolin is just a dueler. 

One of the main themes I enjoyed that took place throughout the entire book is facing the truth of your reality, and the lies we tell ourself to ignore that truth. Pretty much every character had a lie to either each other or themselves, and more often both. It's incredibly relatable, and often found myself reflecting on what was going on in my own life. 

I changed the rating to a 5 out of 5 after some deliberation and thought. I think it deserves it for keeping my attention for just under 1100 pages. The next book, Oathkeeper I think, is up soon. I bought it a while ago at Strand with Sarah, so let's hope it's just as if not better.
