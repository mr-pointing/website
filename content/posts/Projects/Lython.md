Lython is my final project for my Masters program. I based it off an idea I had of giving my students a filtered AI, which branched off into editing ChatGPT with prompt filtering. Seeing that alone was particularly easy, I looked into implementing RAG, which works kind of.

Below is my submission.

I'd like to continue working on my project as an actual tool to use during class. I'd like to be able to launch it to a production server, so my students can access it during class. That way, I can cut the websites to just Lython, and the website they need to submit their assignments on.

So far, I was able to get it downloadable as a PyPI project. Previously I was happy with it being live on their Test server, being on production felt super cool.
