It has been a wild year. It's hard to even think of a time where I didn't have my online notebook as a backup for all of the important information I need on a daily basis. It's moved and changed slightly here and there, but at the end of the day it's consistently been-what I think is the most important part-useful.

Some topics have come and gone. After trying out diary entries I realized I don't get the same sense of satisfaction from it as I do when I write in my physical journal, so that came and went. I only lightly use the dictionary portion of my vault that I don't make public. It's mostly words I come across in books that I have to look up and write down to try and not forget it.

Computer Science as a topic is through and through mostly what I write about since this platform was originally a place to put my notes for my students. That plan hasn't changed, but I'd like to expand eventually.

Of all the projects I took on, the one's I'll continue with most are the textbook breakdowns and project trackers. My notes on getting [Capricornpokes](https://www.capricornpokes.com) finished helped keep track of everything without getting too cluttered or confusing, so that's for sure going to be a part of all my future projects as of right now.

I don't finish books fast enough for that to actually make a dent in the makeup of my vault, but I hope in a few years time to have more posts under the entertainment tab. Honestly the more I write that I want to change the name to something else but that is a year 2 problem. Here are some fun stats as of **_June 19th, 2025_**:

- 385 Notes
- 407 Files
- 21 Attachments
- 306 Links
- 136,433 words
- 13.71 MB
- 116 Excalidraw Drawings

Now the only number I don't really trust there is the word count, due to Excalidraw files skewing that a bit (without them I had 129,650!), but still, not too bad for a first year. Here's a look at my graph view;

I use the Shiba Inu theme with minor tweaks in the settings to add some color pop on the file explorer and background image. I don't use too many community plugins;

- Templater
- Excalidraw
- Omnisearch
- Style Settings
- Update Time on Edit
- Chesser

And lastly, of course, I host all my notes using Hugo :)
