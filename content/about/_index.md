## **Who I Am**

My name is Richard Pointing, a computer science teacher based in Brooklyn, New York. I recently graduated with a Masters in Computer Science, with a focus in Machine Learning and AI.

My focus is in Python, but I've recently been trying to dip my feet in Bash and getting comfortable in Linux. This website is a test to see if I can start doing more things myself (choosing to use Hugo instead of Obsidian Publish).

## **What I'm Working On**

- I'm going through [20 textbooks]({{<ref "20 Textbooks">}}) this year. I want to challenge myself and my ability to not only read but understand and hopefully be able to teach topics from these books.  
- Working on a [30 Day Coding Challenge]({{<ref "Day 1" >}}), building a Tattoo booking web app.
- Working on my first hardware project, a [Vinyl Visualizer]({{< ref "Vinyl Visualizer" >}}).
