## **Who I Am**

My name is Richard Pointing, a computer science teacher based in Brooklyn, New York. I recently graduated with a Masters in Computer Science, with a focus in Machine Learning and AI.

My focus is in Python, but I've recently been trying to dip my feet in Bash and getting comfortable in Linux. This website is a test to see if I can start doing more things myself (choosing to use Hugo instead of Obsidian Publish).

## **What I'm Working On**

- I'm going through [Introduction to Algorithms]({{< ref "Introduction to Algorithms - Chapter 1" >}}), which I read myself when I was an undergrad in college.
- Developing out my Master's Capstone, [Lython]({{< ref "Lython" >}}).
- Working on my first hardware project, a [Vinyl Visualizer]({{< ref "Vinyl Visualizer" >}}).
