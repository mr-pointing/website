## First Edition
**Anna Skoulikari** 

I got this textbook as a part of a DevOps Humble Bundle for a ridiculous price.

I have been using Git more seriously this year, so it makes sense to go through this first. It also is apart of the [AI Engineer Roadmap]({{< ref "AI Engineer Roadmap" >}}), so even more of a reason to start. 


## Who the Textbook is For

Anyone who wants to learn Git, and geared towards individuals who have basic technical skills, or those who need to work alongside those who use Git.


## Using This Book

Chapters 1 - 12 should be followed linearly, mostly because of something their calling the *Rainbow Project*, which seems to be a textbook-long project to follow along on the concepts.  

They throw us some quick vocab words they define but say they'll go into more detail later:

- **Repositories**: basically a copy of a Git project.
- **Commits**: a version of your Git project.

This is not a reference book, but more of an instructional. There will be points of Git that are not relevant or touched upon most likely.

There is also another project that they're calling the *Book Project*. Similar to the Rainbow project, but we won't be building it; it is simply an example to follow along throughout the length of the book.
