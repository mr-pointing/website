## Second Edition

### By Aditya Y. Bhargava


Not only is this book incredibly easy to follow, but it requires very little in terms of prerequisites. The most you need to know is a basic understanding of Python and Algebra. 

This book is for people who already know how to code, hobbyists, visual learners, or anyone who wants to learn algorithms without a rigorous mathematical foundation.

Code for all chapters can be found [here](https://github.com/egonSchiele/grokking_algorithms). All examples are given in Python.
