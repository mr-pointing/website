# From Sorcery to Science

## By Ronald T. Kneusel

Most text's will teach you how to work on or with AI; this is going to teach you what's going on _conceptually_. Considered a "tree-top" approach, we won't get bogged down by math-heavy terminology.

The goal of AI has been the same since 1987; simulate intelligent thought and actions via a machine. Believe it or not, AI has been around us almost our entire lives, mostly without us even being able to recognize it. From basic things like word prediction to route navigation, to today's boom of LLM's, AI is everywhere.

We already know the who- Artificial Intelligence. But what about the what, when, why, and how? That's the purpose of this text.
