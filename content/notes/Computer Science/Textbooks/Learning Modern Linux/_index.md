# A Handbook for the Cloud Native Practitioner

## By Michael Hausenblas

Another book from Humble Bundle, this is a book I'm pretty excited about. I know very little aside from the basics concerning Linux architecture, so I'm looking forward to learning more complicated topics. This text is meant to focus on everyday uses of Linux, from development to standard office.

An important part of this text is it's emphasis on the command-line; this is not going to go over the GUI side of Linux. This book is for anyone who wants or needs to use Linux in the above discussed settings. A lot of the text will read as if the reader doesn't have proficient knowledge of Linux. This again, focuses on the use of Linux, rather than the administration of it.

The text, like many others, heavily recommends trying all of the examples provided. This means working in a Linux environment. Thanks to Framework, I've got that step covered.
