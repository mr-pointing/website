# Playful Programming Activities to Make You Smarter

## By Lee Vaughan

Every good preface begins with identifying the audience. I chose this book over Real World Python mostly because of the audience; this text provides a secondary platform, meant for students who've already had a beginner introduction to the language. I felt while reading Real World that there were too many secondary things I had to explain rather than give Python the full attention it deserves, so here we are. It's not just for students though, but anyone who's curious about conducting their own experiments using coding.

The majority of the projects in this text are meant to diversify your exposure to Python libraries. We've already used some, but we're really going to get a hands-on experience with tons of new libraries. Another reason this book stood out over Real World is the focus on creativity and imagination. These projects are meant to be fun, engaging, and should get your brain moving and grooving.
