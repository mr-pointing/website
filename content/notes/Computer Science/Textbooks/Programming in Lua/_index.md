## Fourth Edition
### By Roberto Ierusalimschy

Lua was initially designed to be integrated with software written in C/C++. It's a small yet powerful language, and achieves this by not trying to do what C already does; perform well. Lua offers dynamic structures, zero redundancies, and a simpler time testing and debugging code. 

It's an *extensible* language; things like dynamic typing, automatic memory management, and first-class functions make Lua a good pick for small to even medium/large projects. It can be sometimes known as a **glue** language; not only holding things together, but also adapting and reshaping them in certain cases.
