A resource by [Code Basics](https://youtube.com/code_basics)


We'll see how this works. Starting in June of 2024, I plan to get myself prepared for a new career after another year of teaching. Pretty much; I want to find a job ideally that starts in the late summer of next year. 

Week 0 is stupid lol.

## **Week 1 and 2 (6/2 - 6/17)**

I have a masters degree in this subject. I think I can handle a khan academy course and going through the entire Python documentation in two weeks. Or at least I hope I can. 

6/18/2024
So, after two weeks, I was able to go through a decent chunk of the Python documentation. It was hubris that thought I could complete something as dense as the Python docs in two weeks. 

I was also able to accomplish a few Leet Code questions, as well as explore a few potential projects for the next coming weeks.

## **Week 3 and 4 (6/18 - 7/2)**

The next two weeks what I'd like to accomplish:
 - [x] Finish The Python Tutorial
 - [x] Start the Library Reference
 - [x] Finish 4 Leet Code Problems
 - [x] Start a project from [this](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x?tab=readme-ov-file#build-your-own-git) GitHub


7/3/2024
Another two weeks in. I definitely overshot myself, which isn't a bad thing. I think 4 goals isn't terrible: I can break it down into two tasks a week. I'll have a little bit better expectation going forward. 

Here are some tech videos I watched in the last two weeks:

[Compilers, How They Work, And Writing Them From Scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdnxjYj1pS0) 

I don't remember why but I saw this and thought it was super interesting.

[What Is REST API? Examples And How To Use It: Crash Course System Design #3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mN3VyJuCjM&t=4s)

This really helped my understanding of REST and helped me understand that concepts I used in my [Designing a RESTful API]({{< ref "Designing a RESTful API" >}}) note. The notes on the REST there.

On that note, I think a project a week is worth it.

As far as the PDF goes, I'm pretty much at where they expect.

## **Week 5 and 6 (7/3 - 7/17)**

The next accomplishments I want to make over the next two weeks:
- [x] Start & Complete a [Git project](https://wyag.thb.lt/)
- [x] Finish The Python Tutorial
- [x] Start the Flask Documentation
- [x] Watch 3 videos from my YouTube watchlist


7/17/2024

I was able to accomplish a lot more this week than last; or at least collect a lot more information I want to learn about.

I finished the Python documentation, but want more info on how to use Python as an object oriented language. I played around with a few examples but I’d like a structured walk through to turn into a lesson for my upperclassmen. 

I technically did finish 3 YouTube videos, but since I only did a write up on two of them, I’ll say it wasn’t accomplished.

I’m going to keep up 4 objectives; I might reuse one or two. 

[Become a Shell Wizard in ~12 Minutes]({{< ref "Become a Shell Wizard in ~12 Minutes" >}}) was the first video which got me way more excited to learn DevOps stuff.

[You Can Do Really Cool Things With Functions in Python]({{< ref "You Can Do Really Cool Things With Functions in Python" >}}) also got me excited, and really pushed me to want to understand more complex Python. Again, more Object Oriented Concepts, mixed with Data classes.

Starting the [Flask's Quickstart]({{< ref "Flask's Quickstart" >}}) documentation also got me working on my capstone project again. I will have to make a note here to track all of that progress.

I’m also starting something new these next two weeks. The objective for the next week is to study algorithms; something I’m particularly bad at. In order to study harder, and hopefully retain more info, I’m going to take notes by hand, then transfer them to Obsidian. We’ll see how that works

## **Week 7 and 8 (7/18 - 8/1)**

- [x] Watch 3 YouTube videos from CompSci 


8/2/2024

I got a lot done, more so than I thought I was going to. Not only that, I've really cleared out my projects list for the next few months. I want to prioritize my time to get my website up, so I can start some online presence. I definitely didn't get anywhere near close to finished with Chapters 1-9, but it's very dense text. 

[Browsers HTTP and You!]({{< ref "Browsers HTTP and You!" >}}) was pretty bunk, the video wasn't very popular and it seemed like it was one of his first videos because he didn't talk very confidently. I stopped after 5 minutes.

[How to Start a Homelab for $0]({{< ref "How to Start a Homelab for $0" >}}) is more of the same from this YouTuber. I've been watching his videos following his influence on wanting to use Hugo to host my website. Homelab seems cool, but it's definitely lower on my list considering what else I'd like to do right now.

[How To Use @dataclass in Python]({{< ref "How To Use @dataclass in Python" >}}) was really interesting, I want to start working on some projects and try to find ways to use data classes instead of regular classes.

I think I'd like to keep the same objectives for the next two weeks.

## **Week 9 and 10 (8/2 - 8/16)**

- [x] Complete Flask documentation Notes
- [x] Finish Chapters 1-9 in Intro to Algorithms
- [x] Get website published using Hugo
- [x] Complete PyCharm IDE Features
- [x] Complete Khan Academy Notes

8/11/2024

Quick midweek update. Getting my website up and running took a huge chunk of my time. So much so that there are still things to do and errors to fix. 

I got [Flask's Quickstart]({{< ref "Flask's Quickstart" >}}) finished, and want to take a little break from Flask for the time being. 


8/17/2024

For last weeks goals, I got three out of five which is better than I originally expected. I was also very generous with myself because my goals were pretty ambitious. 

I already spoke on Flask, I'll likely come back to do a few random pages from there in and out throughout the next school year. 

I also was able to launch my website, as well as get my first [post](https://mrpointing.com/posts/starting-my-website/) up. Separating my site into these really worked for me, I still have a little more to go.

I was able to finish Unit One from Khan Academy. It is a pretty https://mrpointing.com/posts/starting-my-website/comprehensive course, and I will absolutely be referencing my notes when lesson planning this year.

I got about halfway through PyCharm's IDE features, so definitely want to get the next half next block. I also will likely make a small cheat-sheet filled with macros that are useful. 

I only got about 2 chapters into Intro to Algorithms, so I have to readjust my expectations on how fast I'll be going through it. Especially as I understand that it is more academic, it will likely take much longer.

I also want to put a few easy goals on my list, mostly because I had them elsewhere but since they weren't here, I slacked on them a bit.

## **Week 11 and 12 (8/17 - 8/31)**

- [ ] Finish Chapters 2, 3, and 4 in Intro to Algorithms
- [ ] Complete PyCharm IDE Features
- [ ] Finish Chapters 1 and 2 of Learning Git
- [x] Make README for Website
- [ ] Get Obsidian Git set up
- [ ] Work on Obsidian Plugins Post
- [ ] Work on Next Obsidian to Hugo Workflow Post
- [x] Create Now Page for Website


9/1/2024

September is here. I've been using Obsidian for 3 months now officially, and I can say it has definitely motivated me to continue learning and actually do something with the knowledge I've accumulated throughout my life. I'm excited to continue and eventually finish this roadmap, and really visualize the progress.

Now that September has come so has my job. Which means I'm going to be prioritizing lesson planning and such over taking personal notes. That doesn't mean I want to stop; quite the opposite. I'd actually like to ramp up and start integrating my work notes and such into Obsidian. I also plan to teach my students how to create their own Vault and note-taking tips.

As far as my personal note-taking progress has gone for the last two weeks, I feel like I both accomplished a lot and left a lot undone. First and foremost-the Introduction to Algorithms textbook is hard. Matter of fact, I think it's harder to read now than when I was in class during my undergrad nearly 10 years ago. It's really kicking my ass, but after reading online about professionals opinion on the book, it's a pretty universal opinion that the book is beyond dense. I'll likely get the Grokking Algorithms book soon in order to supplement my reading, but as far as Algorithms go, I'm not going to stress it too hard.

I completed some more of those Python questions from the Roadmap, but haven't completed them fully. I'll definitely add those onto the list for this week. I got A LOT done for the website (made it dark mode only, made two posts, got the README done, now page, etc.). I found that since I'm already paying for sync and I have the site, using Obsidian Git wasn't very worthwhile for me. 

For this next two week sprint, I want to start tackling some of the existing notes in here (aka my ghost notes). I'm also a bit behind on the roadmap so I have to play a little catch-up. I'll feel comfortable once I can read the entire PDF, and not have any questions or feel okay answering a question on all of the topics mentioned (or at least have them available as a resource.)

## **Week 13 and 14 (9/1 - 9/15)**

- [ ] Finish Chapter 3 in Intro to Algorithms
- [ ] Finish PyCharm IDE Features
- [ ] Finish Chapters 3, 4, and 5 in Learning Git
- [ ] Work on Obsidian Plugins Post
- [ ] Review SQL
- [ ] Work on NumPy and Pandas notes
