As shown in one of the chapter 10 in the [Python Tutorial]({{< ref "The Python Tutorial Notes - Chapter 10" >}}), we can send emails over a built-in `smtplib` module that you can send emails with. You can find a basic example there. In wanting to implement a email to the tattoo booking app, I wanted to do a tutorial on how I can set it up so that emails are sent from the tattoo artist's email address, so it would be easy for the client to respond.
