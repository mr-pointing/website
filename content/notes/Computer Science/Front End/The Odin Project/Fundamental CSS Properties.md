Since there are a ton of CSS properties, you don't and shouldn't memorize all of them. Let's review a few of the most common and useful ones to make your websites stand out.

### Background

The `background` property is used mostly as is to set colors and styles to the background frame. However, you actually can use specific background-properties, which effect more specific elements in your background. You can go through exactly what you can do with that in [this](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background) documentation. 


### Borders

Two useful properties; `border` and `border-radius`. `border` does exactly what you think- sets the border of your element. `border-radius` is neat, since that's what let's you give rounded corners to your elements. For more details, look through [this](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border) documentation.


### Box-shadow

Adds a shadow effect to your element. Can create depth on your pages, but should be used sparingly as to not create unreadable sites.

### Overflow

Used to help manage content that doesn't fit in the element it's stored in. You can pass useful strategies like `scroll` to give your elements a scrollbar, or `clip` if you want your content cut off.
