## Fourth Edition
### Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, Clifford Stein


## Preface

Algorithms are everywhere, apart of almost everything we do, and every decision we make. They are part of most if not all tech stacks used today.

Each chapter in this book will present an algorithm, an application area for some algorithm, or some other related topic.

### For teaching purposes

The less complex the audience, the less complex chapters you need. You can pick and choose what you want to take from this, being so comprehensive of a text. Even a section instead of a whole chapter is completely viable.

There are 931 exercises and 162 problems (I'll attempt all of them).

Solutions are [here](http://mitpress.mit.edu/algorithms/).

Starred chapters are meant for for graduate students, rather than undergrad. They aren't necessarily harder, but might feature harder math, more complex concepts, etc.


### For students

A question: what are some of the pre-requisites for this book?
- Some programming experience, specifically with:
	- Recursive procedures
	- Simple data structures (arrays, linked lists)
- Mathematical Proofs
	- Proofs by mathematical induction
	- Elementary calculus
	- Part 1 & Appendices A - D explain all math needed
