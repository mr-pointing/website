**Previous:** [Words of Radiance]({{< ref "Words of Radiance" >}})

Definitely a novella that took me too long to finish, and not really because I was enjoying it. More so because I didn't love Lift as a character. I was actually going to say I didn't hate their childish behavior, but typing that out I had a gut feeling I wasn't being honest with myself.

I really *didn't* like how childish Lift was. Maybe that was her point, but I didn't seem to grasp onto the story. Wendel, her spren, being a Squidward-type that doesn't want to go anywhere or do anything was a nice contrast, but I couldn't help feel sorry that we find out the character Wendel could have been with died in one of the earlier books, and was a more interesting character.

Stump, the random old woman, being a radiant was a nice twist, and finding out that Nale was a Herald the whole time did build out the universe in a satisfying way. I don't think that justifies this being it's own book. I think it could easily been it's own few chapters in [Oathbringer]({{< ref "Oathbringer" >}}) and I would have enjoyed it more. 3 out of 5 for me.
