Not much to say about this one that hasn't already been said; regardless, a great insight into the past and what it means to unite with your fellow human peers. The forward clues you into the perspective of the world's reaction to it. It's hard to believe, since now banding together against a stronger and more materially wealthy minority is such a common theme that persists through countless forms of media. 

I'm excited to get more into Marx's works, and the others recommended on the publishing I have. I didn't grab any good quotes from it, but it did light a fire under my ass to continue reading more political-related books.
