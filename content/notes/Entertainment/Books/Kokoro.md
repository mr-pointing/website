I've really been killing it recently with the beautifully written tragic stories. This time, Meiji-era Japan as our theme and Natsume Soseki as our conductor. I really enjoyed Kokoro, and at many moments fueled with a tender inner-flame that kept me attached to the narrator. Even when it transitioned to Sensei's story, I continued to read it from the narrators perspective.

I have a lot of thoughts and opinions about this one, so I'll try to be brief. While I enjoyed the book a lot, and I'm surely not the first person to notice this, but sooooooo much of the events of this book become trivial when you consider how easy it would have been had these characters grew up in a setting where openly communicating your feelings was normal. This story could only work in the time and place the settings in, and for that I appreciate it for what it is. That being said, so many times I thought of how silly these characters are behaving.

Sensei is kind of a jerk, and I imagine to an extent the narrator must also be to be attracted to Sensei in the first place. Again, there could be a lot of cultural context I'm not clued into since my knowledge of the customs of the time is limited, but I'll give the narrator some credit given he's younger and more impressionable.

The story of Sensei's life was at time extremely relatable while other times not so much. I found it odd because he was cheated by his extended family his hatred would go outward towards everyone, feeling these feelings when he is openly being accepted and accepting a brand new family of non blood relatives (Otosan, Ojosan, and K). There are times where Sensei openly condradicts himself and admits it, but passes it off as a quirk of who he is as a person. I can sympathize with that, but it makes perfect sense the way the story progressed if that's the kind of character we're dealing with.

I find it kind of hilarious that Sensei lives his entire life with this secret emotional baggage, see's how terrible it was for both him and his dead friend, and *still continues to tell the narrator to keep the emotional baggage of his life*. Like, do you really not like this guy? He asked to get to know you more and your answer is keep this posthumous secret from my wife until she's gone? To be honest I'm kind of glad the story ended so abruptly, cause if we got the narrators point of view and he WASN'T pissed off it would've been insanely unrealistic. Either way, the writing was incredibly strong up until the end, and left me wanting more. Can't wait to read more Soseki. Solid 4 out of 5.
