Another killer Philip K. Dick piece, and although not my favorite from him, a quick and compelling read. What I got most out of this "new" America was the constant fear about the self-the fear of losing your identity, or the fear of your identity aligning with your perceived identity. Majority of the characters come face to face with outward-adversity, but only briefly. For most of the book the characters are just trying to exist in a society where identity is everything and means absolutely nothing.

Time and time again Dick shows us that the meaning prescribed by the populace onto actions and items is meaningless. Meaning is only given in the context of two peoples reaching an agreement: I think this is worth $50, you also think it's worth $50, so I sell it to you for $50. What is the actual worth of the object? Is it $50 because we said it was, or is it $5000 because someone online might buy it for that price? What if someone views it as priceless? The point is there is no point, it's whatever we want it to be. This translates well into the theme of human culture. A group of people is only a group of "savages" via the point-of-view of people who want to believe that group is that way. In a world where lines are set in the sand using blatant racial stereotypes (not the best delivery in this regard imo), it's quite funny that everyone relies on an Oracle that uses chance to predict the future.

I loved the sub-novel that surrounded the lives of all of our characters. For a good bit I thought it might go down the path of, "this is actually the real world and we're living in the alternate reality" for the book, and the author would be some sort of multi-dimensional traveler. I respect that Dick had the restraint to not do that, but I did find myself confused by the ending claiming that Japan and Germany did actually lose the war. I thought maybe at first it might be a symbolic lost, since even though they won they ended up using up all of the Earth's resources and blew it up, but a small inkling of a feeling had me re-reading the chapter to see if there was anything I missed. 

I did some reading and did not catch on at *all* that the lines of reality/the world in the novel were bleeding together. Not only did the scene I just bring up feature this (Julianna admitting the Axis powers never won) but also in the previous chapter where Mr. Tagomi ends up in a "real" San-Francisco. While reading I didn't even catch it, I figured he was just seeing reality for the way it actually was rather than the reality the Axis powers wanted it's citizens to believe in. 

I had a great time, and even though I think it might be my least-favorite of his, it's still a very solid 3 out of 5.
