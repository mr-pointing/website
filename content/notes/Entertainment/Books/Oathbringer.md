Holy Moly. What a ride. This book took *FOREVER* to finish. Exactly 3 months and a day to be exact. But it was so worth it.

A true continuation from [Words of Radiance]({{< ref "Words of Radiance" >}}), this book follows the logical progression from where that book left off and really begins to open up the world. There are still lots of secrets left to unfold (Who is Wit? Who is the Cremling God that Lift meets in Edgedancer? What's going to happen with Renarin? How is Odium going to exploit Taravangian? WHY DOESN'T KALADIN AND SHALLAN GET TOGETHER???) which has me very excited for the next two books.

The most emotional scenes for me were easily anything with Teft, obviously Kaladin, and an astonishing amount of sympathy built up for Dalinar. It was awesome to see the "addict" troupe not fall through into *too* much stereotyped non-sense and see Teft speak the words. I ended up really loving Dalinar's character, when usually after a character is revealed to be a terrible person, I tend to feel similarly and dislike them over time. This time though, Dalinar stands out as a real dude. He just wants to be a better man. Who doesn't?

I think I'm going to give it a 5 out of 5. I'm not sure if it deserves the same praise as Words of Radiance, but it's right up there.
