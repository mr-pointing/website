While browsing a Strand affiliated pop-up next to central park one spring day not so many weeks ago, a good friend picked this book up and told me it was one of their favorite books. I of course took their opinion seriously, given I'll read, watch, or play just about anything a friend recommends out of principle. It's situations like this very one that makes that principle worth while; this book was amazing.

Following the story of a young teen, H책kan, traveling to the United States with his brother during the gold rush but get's unexpectedly separated and H책kan is sent on a journey from California to New York with no way of communicating or living. We watch his growth from a roughly innocent youth, and bear witness to the insurmountable tragedy of living on one's own during one of the most intense and rough eras in the history of the United States. His trials and tribulations are relatable, heart-warming, sometimes heart-wrenching, and all together beautiful.

The only thing I knew going into this book was that the descriptions of the places you visit were vivid enough to feel as if you were actually there. That was evidently accurate, as from the most jarring opening page I can remember to the breathtaking views Diaz walks you through as H책kan manages to survive in the Desert. The theme of loss is so prevalent throughout H책kan's life it's hard to find the silver lining if not for the articulation moving him from space to space.

It was a short read, taking me about a week, but it was a week that I looked forward to picking it up almost every day. Incredibly worthwhile, I don't want to give many story beats away as they are best experienced fresh, so I'll leave this review with a 5 out of 5.
