One that's been on my reading list since I was a kid and saw the dynamic spiral cover, Ring is the original book that inspired the prolific and perfectly-spoofed movie of the same name. Hearing this was a series made me nervous this wouldn't be great, but I ended up enjoying it at some parts.

It went by really fast. The main character was the *worst* dude. Hated how much he clearly did not care about his wife and kids until he put them in danger. Spoiler alert, this guy has the worst gut instincts of all time. He of course becomes friends with the other worst character of all time, and unfortunately make a dynamic duo.

The second character lies about sexually assaulting women to hide being gay? Maybe? Lot of things are implied and themes are pretty up in the air for interpretation, until the very end where they hand feed you some explanations for things. A few weeks after reading it I can't remember much except for the fact that the way to break the "curse" is so easy and takes legitimately no effort to circumnavigate that it dampens the little suspense felt throughout the plot. Leaving it at 3/5 and calling it a day.
