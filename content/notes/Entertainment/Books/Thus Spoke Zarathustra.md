A philosophical endeavor to say the least, Thus Spoke Zarathustra was a tough read and an enlightening one. To start, this is a book I've owned for many years. As a teenager, I had only a cursory understanding of who Nietzsche was, and was angsty/thought he had all the answers to my questions. It was exactly the opposite; I thought I knew what he was talking about, but I had not even a hint of a clue.

The prose is tough, at times extremely hard to follow. I don't love the book for this, the parable style writing makes the allegories and metaphors intangible with such a gap in knowledge of the context in which the text was written. If not for the end notes, reading this would have been a slog. Moments stood out, especially when it was a moment in which I actually understood what he was trying to say.

I'm walking away feeling better about my place in the world. I don't know if that's his intentions, but I felt most of his stories were interpretable enough to compare against my own life and feelings. Moreover, I can see how people can take his lessons and interpret them in all sorts of ways, not just deviously. It's no mistake that fascist ideologies found home in this text, using the "Will to Power" as a means of justifying their regime.

I found a good amount of this book to be insightful, some quotes I'd even use beautiful to describe. Mostly though, there were ideas and concepts that have been with me for a while, not just following Zarathustra. I love life in spite of the great evils humans commit, just like Zarathustra. Like him, knowing that the church doesn't always have the best intention doesn't make him a harsh cynical, but sets him on his own path to find his own meaning. No doom and gloom, just growth and search for true meaning. 

## Quotes

"But the awakened one, the knowing one, says: 'Body am I entirely, and nothing more; and soul is only the name of something about the body.'"

"Truly, I too learned to wait and profoundly so, -but only to wait for *myself*...By diverse ways and windings I arrived at my truth; not by a single ladder did I mount to the height where my eye roves into my remoteness. And it was only reluctantly that I ever asked the way-that has always offended my taste! Rather I questioned and tried the ways themselves."

"One should not wish to enjoy where one has not given joy."

"Do not let yourselves be carried up, do not sit on the backs and heads of strangers! But you mounted a horse? You are not riding briskly up to your goal? Well, my friend! But your lame foot is also with you on horseback!"
