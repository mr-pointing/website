I finished Naruto today. I really enjoyed reading it; I nearly flew through it in just over or under 3 months. I had a blast-Kishimoto's art was really fun and emotive and kept me wanting to see just how each page would grow in more detail and impact. I think it delivered in that respect. The last 100 chapters had many great panels-none screenshot worthy in my opinion like the beginning/middle of the series but regardless a lot of fun.

The story couldn't have ended in any other way that would have felt satisfying. Sasuke is through and through a jerk. I think him getting with Sakura is cope and is for the fans. From the jump this guy has straight up not given her the time of day. I read the whole series and I now can say with my chest there's no way Sasuke/Sakura makes sense. 

Women overall are poorly written as a critique makes a lot of sense given his female characters all care about men in some regard a little too much. Tsunade pretty much just cared about Konoha like a boss (Dan but he died). Maybe Kuranai might stand out as the only one who had a goal non-adjacent to another guy but then Asuna dies and she has his child so. Not sure how to feel about that.

Once I link my phone I'll upload some of my favorite screenshots. I think that might be a good way to remember the series.

I'm glad to do this. Since my brain is fried, I forget critical moments like whole series if I don't take some substantial time for reflection. Even if I do, I can just look back and this and remember.
