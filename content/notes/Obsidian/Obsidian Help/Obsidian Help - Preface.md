# What is Obsidian?

Essentially, a note-taking tool. All it boils down too is the format in which your notes are placed (I just think Obsidian is neat). Obsidian uses a Markdown, a markup-language. Not really a programming language, more of an *encoding* language, but we don't need to worry about that for right now.

For now, all we are going to focus on is the basics-you have something you want to take notes on, and you write down your notes inside. No (strict) syntax, no indenting, no errors, no worries. Unlike a standard document editor however (think Word) it lacks the ability and flare of the more powerful applications.

Obsidian is meant to be lightweight. Not just as a software, but on out-of-the-box options as well. You start very simply, with hashtags and a weird looking is thing you can't really type. We'll get there.

Once you have a few notes, then we start to incorporate the **Tag** system, to give our notes more meaning. If our notes are alike, we can **Link** them as well, or even just for reference. You'll really begin to see the bigger picture once you open up **Graph View**, which shows the links and tags between your notes. 

After you understand the lay of the land is when you can really start to take off. We haven't even touched on the customization aspect-easily the biggest selling point behind using it (besides the files being super easy to access). We can add in **Themes** to give it a more personalized look, or **Plugins** to completely change the experience. We're going to go over a few plugins this year for sure.
